/*
The following CSS variables define the main, public API for styling JupyterLab.
These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other
words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely
necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab
by changing these variables.

Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences
are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should
be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings:

* 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis
* 1: primary, most important under normal situations
* 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations
* 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations

Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's
Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following
all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs.

<pre>'I love these cookies. I am on the paleo diet right now and these cookies are what I look forward too. I do like the taste of the tropical one the best. They all have different taste but if you want something that is grain free and gluten free then this is the right place. I expected the taste to be different and it is. Other reviewers seem to expect them to taste like oreos or chips ahoy. Of course not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I eat them, I don\'t even feel bad about it because my body welcomes them. They don\'t make me crash either and feel like I ate junk food. It is a good indicator that these were made from all natural ingredients. I wish I had these cookies close to me. I\'d buy them every single day! I thought I\'d try the multi-pack to see which flavor I liked the best, but I like them all. They are healthy, fulfilling, and all good ingredients I can actually pronounce. These are the smaller packs, and now I can proceed to ordering the larger bags. Love these cookies! i just started the paleo diet and i love it! lost 4 lbs in like a week! anyway i was so glad to find out there are paleo cookies out there and thank goddess they\'re good!! i loved the original and when they sent me them i got a sample of tropical and i loved that too! so i ordered the tropical and got a sample of rainforest! at first they\'re good but if you read the ingredients u\'ll see there is cayenne pepper in it and im really sensitive to hot spices and i could SOOO feel it on my tong! it was like an after taste. but if u enjoy a little fire with ur sweet u\'ll like rainforest flavor! really wanna try the alpine flavored ones they\'re a lot darker in color so it should be interesting :) good job caveman bakery! I LOVE YOU! I\'ve been Paleo for six months, as has my partner. We both found these inedible. All four kinds (which, by the way, taste nearly the same).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\'m not sure what it is about them either. It seems like they would be good from the ingredients. But something about the combination of flavors just does not taste good. I kept trying them again, hoping that they would grow on me. They sure didn\'t. We finally tossed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I would advise getting just one from a local co-op or something before you buy a whole bunch online. I sure which I had. I bought a 40 sampler pack from the caveman bakery website. It\'s not exactly like a cookie consistency however the texture and chewiness of the cookie I like. They kind of remind me of like those natural nut and fruit bars, like kind or something. Of the ones I\'ve tried, Alpine and Tropical are my favorites mainly because alpine has hazelnut and tropical has a coconut taste in it. The least favorite that I\'ve tried is either the rainforest, it has a strong taste of ginger and I\'m not a fan of ginger. The other ones are pretty good too. However, I didn\'t realize that these cookies were so small, but I guess based on the big portions of today\'s society, this is a normal portion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its good, would I buy again? Maybe if I was on a strict gluten-free diet. Formula itself is great. Works wonders for a baby that spits up but WTF... why is it so expensive here? $121 for 6 12.9oz cans. That\'s $20 for a 12.9oz can when you can buy a 24oz can at any store for less than $25. Almost double the price...I don\'t get it. With all of the choices of things to drink, this is an excellent one. It tastes great. Most of our choices are either loaded with sugar, or carbonated ... even milk is sugar-dense. This drink is good for blood pressure and cholesterol. It is an excellent thirst-quencher. So much better for the hot summer months than sugary lemonade! It does, however acidify the pH. I am supposed to be alkalizing my diet, so I can\'t drink a lot of this. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the time I was a small child, my mother was an advocate of apple cider vinegar and honey for health. Hippocrates would have been happy to discover Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar All Natural Drink: Concord Grape Acai :))) Try it and drink to good health! This may not be the best tasting thing I have ever drank but man do I feel instant results after drinking some. I would best describe the effects as very close to the good feeling you experience when you drink coffee. I notice that my circulation feels fantastic like my whole body is warm, a very healthy dose of energy and I dont notice any jitteryness like coffee or energy drinks give you.  The only reason I didnt rate it 5 start is because a 16oz bottle is $3.00 which I think is a little steep. But for the great feeling I get when I drink some I would highly recommend it to anyone else who wants to feel a boost of energy as well as a general sense of well being. Let me preface this by saying I purchased it at a local health food store for about a dollar less. I was pleasantly surprised with this drink. It tastes great, but definitely a little tangy. What I loved about this was how great I felt after drinking it. I felt awake and focused, and just overall really good. I will definitely be buying more. I love using generous amounts of vinegar on sandwiches, salads, etc., but this drink was so vinegary that I got a bit of a tummy ache.  It tasted closer to salad dressing than it did a drink.  I tried really hard to like it, but no go. I bought this drink locally and I have to tell you, they got it \'just right\'. If you are like me and you like the flavor of vinegar, this drink will not disappoint, if you also like the flavor of grape. The mixture was done perfectly, No stinging taste, it\'s sort of mellow, yet has that flavor of vinegar you are looking for. I am highly impressed with it. I went back today and bought 5 more bottle of it at the local Co-op. Braggs is a highly regarded apple cider vinegar, so, to have that kind of base to start with means alot. I can pretty much promise you, that you will \'not\' be disappointed if you buy it. They have a couple other flavors, which I will eventually try, but this one has me hooked. hehe ) This is the best ever.  Just add HOT water and mix.  Yummy with anything can even add to cream sauces and soups.  Add some sausage and you are in Heaven.  Yummy Yum.  Cannot go wrong ordering this product. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOUM68"&gt;Pioneer Brand Gravy Mix, Country, 2.75-Ounce Packets (Pack of 24)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had this gravy  at the Breakfast Buffet in the motel in Branson, MO.&lt;br /&gt;Very Good!!! The waitress told me the name, so I looked it up on the Internet and found it at Amazon.  I give it the Excellent Rating We use these for our daughter for a few reasons. One, they are healthier than other cereal bars on the market (whole grain). Two, they have yogurt incorporated into the bar. Three, the are thick and do not easily crumble. Since our daughter starting eating them when she was about 1, not having to clean up after she\'s eaten them is a BIG plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, they are super yummy for adults too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are more expensive than others on the market (esp since I can get Nutrigrain bars in bulk at a discount) but they are worth it. Makes our life easier and they don\'t have a ton of added sugars! These are really excellent breakfast bars. Note to the previous reviewer: the Nutrigrain bars, last I checked, had artificial color in them. These don\'t. They also taste very good. This is our third order through Amazon (great price) and my daughter misses them when we\'re out. The flavor of the fruit enclosed is outstanding(bluberry) and if there is  a drawback it is that the blanket that encloses the fruit is a bit thick (unlike this companys fig bars) and pastry textured.Flavored with cane  syrup(not fruit juice).150 cal per bar,and low in fat and the carbs(29) not too bad considering the great taste. I keep a box of these in my desk at work.  They make a wonderful snack or are great if I didn\'t have time for breakfast. my boys have been eating these for over 3 years now. Recently the box has been redesigned. I like it and it\'s much easier to open now. It used to have sharp edges and made it easy to get paper cuts. It seems the recipe has changed for the bar. it\'s softer than what it used to be. The boys still like it. They eat only this all day long if I let them. I bought these bars for several years at my local co-operative grocery store, and ate them daily--they are tasty. However, the price increased nearly 100% during that time, and I noticed that, although the individual wrappers within the box remained the same size, the bar within the wrapper decreased. When I stopped buying these, the actual bar was only half the size of the wrapper. That\'s deceptive packaging, so I refuse to buy these any more. I suspect that other shoppers likewise complained, because last month the store where I bought these stopped carrying them. Whole family likes these.  Tasty but not over sweet.  Much more healthy for you than most bars.  Excellentprice through Amazon on the repeating order subscription. barbara\'s yogurt bars are okay.  i found the whole grain bar very dry and there really isn\'t much blueberry, or for that matter, apple flavors.  on the positive side, the bar is a soft chew.  total carbs 29g.  it\'s an okay bar in the glut of cereal bars to choose from at the grocery store. My son has been eating these for the last two years and loves them.  I love them because they have yogurt in them, and for a picky eater provides some good nutrition.  Wish they were organic, but we can\'t have them all.  Much healthier than Nutragrain. This product was a big disappointment.  The picture on the box is misleading.  These bars aren\'t chunky, the dough isn\'t flaky (more like cardboardy), they aren\'t filled with pieces of fruit, and if you didn\'t read the label (which claims about 30 items down the ingredient list that "yogurt powder" is added), you wouldn\'t have any idea you were eating yogurt at all.  The bars probably contain MSGs, with all of the "natural flavorings," etc.  Whatever calcium and other vitamins might be present have probably been added in what the ingredients list calls a "vitamin blend" -- there\'s too little food in the bar to give you much nutrition, anyway.  The experience is very much like eating a long, thin fig bar -- only not as tasty.  The fig bars I buy at my neighborhood grocery contain sugar, but also real fruit, whole wheat, no MSGs, and no trans fats. I\'d rather eat one of them. I won\'t be purchasing this product again. These aren\'t as good as other bars of this type. My kids won\'t eat them, nor will my husband. They are all fond of the Nutrigrain variety, but I thought these would be a healthier alternative. Good product! good price  fast shipping . needs an insert in lid to seal container better! Looked like a good deal, so I ordered the ground fennel, as well as 4 other spices and seasonings from this company, but was disappointed with them all. Zero flavor, not even the fragrance of the right herbs or spices when loosely sealed containers were opened. The dill smelled like dried musty grass, and the onion even worse. Ended up throwing them all away...save your money, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I couldn\'t find this product in the store.  I love the size and the price was just right.  Love the promptness of the delivery. As an avid rice cracker fan, I\'ve tried a lot of different varieties, and this is the best as far as taste and availability goes. Obviously some of the best are in the Japanese grocery stores, but at least in my case, they\'re out of the way most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crackers themselves are savory and crunchy--exactly what I look for in this snack (and this particular mix is nothing but crackers!).&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to these, I\'ve stopped trying out the regular grocery store imitations. Our Corgi loves all sizes, shapes, and flavors of Dingo Bone treats!  The other reviewer commented on the VENDOR; we\'ve never got a bad Dingo yet!  Highly recommended! When I received this product it was old and dried out!  Dingo makes a good product.  I buy them all the time and my dog loves them but this supplier should pay more attention to what they ship. most of the nuts in these bags were so old they had turned black totally worthless will never order again I did not even receive the correct product, what I received were raw UNSHELLEd peanuts, but had no option to return them becuase amazon does not allow this. I attempted to contact but got no reply, do not buy from here! &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6BCC"&gt;Royal Oak  Gourmet Virginia Raw In Shell Peanuts, 2.5 Pound Bags (Pack of 3)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\'ll appreciate your speedy deliver of my package, however you sent me raw peanuts without the shell.  This item is going into a gift basket for my Pastor because he love raw peanuts in a shell.  I don\'t have time to returned them for the requested product. You have always been prompt with my orders in the past and I really do appreciate.  This is the first time you sent me an incorrect product.  I\'ll make it work. I would agree with the other poor ratings for Royal Oak - very poor customer service from Royal Oak. We ordered, this year, the exact same product as last year. When it arrived, the nuts were not the same product, and they would not refund or pay shipping for the return. Also, they only operate the few weeks that peanuts are \'in season.\' Otherwise, emails and phone calls are not even acknowledged. I recommand this product. My childrens (5 and 3) love it, pouches as very usefull especially for breaks.&lt;br /&gt;To choose. Enjoy I\'ve tried many different brands of Virginia peanuts but these are far and away the best. I\'ve turned my entire family on to this brand and they\'ve ordered them also. They\'re superb. First of all, there are two kinds of paprika - sweet and hot.  Both are delicious but the Szeged sweet paprika is more versatile than the hot kind (which is also awesome!). I have been using this spice for years and the Hungarian type is consistently better than any other type/brand.  Use this on meat, veggies, cassaroles, salad, baked bries, quiches, egg dishes, shrimp, pretty much anything.  I use this in soup all winter long, especially with gulyas levas (this is a traditional Hungarian soup though it is often confused with goulash) and czipetke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the large restaurant size, which is the only size to have if you do any amount of cooking because once you try this you will love it\'s versatility!!!! I was so pleased with this purchase. A great value since I got them on a monthly sale!! I love to have these on hand for they come into play so nicely in so many recipes. Always a joy to have a good "crunch" in some recipes. One of my favorite ways to use this larger can is to wrap a piece of bacon around them and secure with a toothpick. Then I dip them in a Apricot Ginger marinade and put in the oven until the bacon is crisp. My family loves an appetizer dinner once in a while and this is one of their favorites. Be mindful that this is a larger can so have a couple of recipes in mind for them when opening, although they do stay fresh in the frig for a while. Not only is the sweetener great in coffee or ice tea it makes a slammin skinny margarita.  Also try their Agava Simple Syrup - LOVE IT I adore using this very vanilla bean paste ESPECIALLY for my cream pies and ice cream. Why, it\'s like adding a "touch of heaven", but without any of the bother of scraping out vanilla bean pods. The flavor is also better to my liking too than vanilla beans. The price is WAY, way better too and it\'s stores fabulously on the shelf for ages!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For combined shipping, be sure to get their SWEET DOUGH FLAVORING and POWDERED VANILLA too. You\'ll be glad you did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more cooking tips &amp; techniques... google my name SharonAnne. Enfamil Premium Lipil Formula is the same as the previous flagship Mead Johnson formula--Enfamil Lipil--except that it has "prebiotics" added in.  Our son was on Enfamil Lipil from September 2007-September 2008.  He was breastfed and formula fed during this time.  Our daughter, who is due in January 2010, will also be breastfed and formula fed for her first year of life.  We tried two other formulas with our son--Similac Advance and Parent\'s Choice.  The Similac was fine but clumped badly.  During the time we experimented with the Parent\'s Choice formula, my son was consistently troubled by colds and the flu.  I think the Parent\'s Choice formula lowered his immunity somehow and will never use it again.  I believe that Mead Johnson\'s decision to use prebiotics is a good one.  Our son had colic/acid reflux in part because his digestive system was not yet populated with the good bacteria for breaking down milk proteins.  He was a lot more comfortable after we started putting a little Culturelle (a probiotic) in his formula in the evening.  And since a lot of our immune system is in our digestive tract, he had fewer sick days after introducing the Culturelle.  Probiotics and prebiotics will also help infants rebound from the negative effects of antibiotics like amoxicillin quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the bpa found in formula can liners, I talked to an Enfamil customer service representative who told me that Mead Johnson now uses cans that are lined with a "modified polyester" that is bpa free.  Similac Advance Earlyshield comes in a bpa-free can also (the SimplePac container).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another concern parents have is the cost of formula.  Name brand formulas are expensive!  But if you think about it, you are feeding a human being for about $15 a week (a can usually lasts us 1.5 to 2 weeks).  $15 a week is peanuts compared to what a hungry teenager devours!  And with name brand formulas you are getting the absolute best product available--Bill Gates couldn\'t buy a better formula than what\'s on the shelves at Target or Wal-mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a new parent and feel overwhelmed by the infant formula section of your grocery store (as I was in September 2007), I suggest starting with the flagship formula of either Mead Johnson (Enfamil Premium Lipil), Abbott Laboratories (Similac Advance Earlyshield), or Nestle (Good Start Gentle Plus or Good Start Protect Plus).  They are all excellent infant formulas.  You just have to see what works for you and your baby. I wish I found the plastic refill packs instead of 6 giant metaL cans - seems like a lot of wasted packaging.  I just didn\'t know to look for them until much later.  But, its much cheaper from amazon than the gocery store.  Probably about the same price as costco but no tax here and super convenient. And, the formula mixes well, my kid loves it and (most importantly) his poops seem normal...not nasty formula poops if you know what I mean! Alot of moms like me like this item because our babies have no constapation on it i love it very much. no gas for baby, no extra bubbles when you shake it in warm or cold water, mixes perfectly without much time... this is easy.  my kid was happy swapping from breast milk to this with no hesitation when my milk dried up at 6mths. We had to move to formula when our baby was 8 weeks. We have found Enfamil Premium to mix easier than the regular Enfamil Lipil. Our baby has had no digestive issues from the formula. I love getting it in bulk from Amazon as it saves the weekly trip to the store for formula. The price (with free shipping) is comparable with local grocery stores in the Austin Area. Our Baby loves it. And Amazon is very reliable and fast free super saver shipping is always a good deal. Thanks amazon. I read other reviews before buying and they are not encoraging.. But still for some reasons, I got  to buy (to use my amazon gift card).  But then I am very happy with the purchase. Delivery is prompt. Quantity is correct . Over all a few bucks savings than you buy at a retail shop. Go to Costco, and you can buy lower than this  price per oz. Currently $32 ($3 off regular $34.99)+ tax for big size = 0.83$/oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, it is more convinient to return if you kid does not like this formula&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful, many times some sellers over price a product, and still make the product rank in the best sellers. Be careful when odering this, because they say it\'s a 6 pk, but you will only get a 4 pk, plus the formula goes out in 4 months.  So if you did like I did and got it early for grandchildren your out of luck!  So I know I will not be buying off of this site again for food for my grandchildren, because they won\'t be able to eat it. If one reads this products ingredients they will find that the first ingredient is cows milk, then SUGAR (diabetic maker), then milk, again. The fourth ingredient is sunflower oil, fifth ingredient is maltodextrin which is starch produced from grain containing the sugars maltose and dextrin, with the seventh ingredient being, get this, tuna fish oil. They even feature vitamin D3, which is animal derived. There are four different sugar sources in it and some artificial flavor for good measure. If we really think about what we are feeding our babies, would we use this product? I know I wouldn\'t. Know your food sources. Have tried a few different peanut brittle\'s from Amazon and this is by far the best. It is LOADED with peanuts plus being in a sealed tin makes it seem fresher wit minimal breakage. These were rancid upon receipt.  Terrible.  Very little sugar if any used.  Something went wrong with these as I can\'t believe anyone would see this as a final product.  Both cans! I like that these are organic and don\'t have corn syrup.  My kids and I both like them.  I\'d give them 5 stars but I noticed earlier this year that they changed the recipe.  The crackers are lighter and flakier than they used to be and they break more easily.  And if you have kids under 5, you might understand how upsetting broken crackers can be.  The taste is still great, but I preffered the old texture myself and definitely for my kids who cry when the crackers break while they are eating them.  And when you order these in the mail, like I did last time, don\'t expect many full graham cracker sheets - most are already broken in two, and quite a few are broken at the edges as well. I have been buying  new Morning Graham Crackers since February of 2010. Never had a Problem with damage of the crackers in shipping .&lt;br /&gt;Why Did Amazon Remove the Graham Crackers From Subscribe and Save?????  Why Did Amazon Remove The Graham Crackers From Prime ???The Crackers are a much Higher Price From a Third Party Seller. I will Purchase the Crackers From Whole Foods . Not Fair of Amazon to Take Away the Connivence of Ordering a Case My husband has to limit the amount of sugar he takes in and these contain no sugar, and they taste great! I rarely want to eat much when I first arise in the morning; but I do have coffee.  I\'ve found that these cinnamon graham crackers work great for me as a little something to eat along with my coffee.  They are graham crackers - not anything super-duper amazing - but they are nice, cinnamony graham crackers that are organic. My children will only eat healthy products, and they love these graham crackers.  I am so glad that they are available through Amazon! These crackers are terrific, and they are priced right.  However, i ordered them on 10/29/06, and the expiration date on the box was 12/31/06.  We have only eaten four boxes.  They still taste fine after the expiration date, but... am i really expected to consume 12 boxes in 2 months? These are very good, they were a great price and fast-free shipping when you purchase enough food.  The only thing is that the box was smaller than I guessed it would be. I was quite surprised to find that Sociables were available thru Amazon. I cannot find them in the local supermarkets and thought I would have to give them up.&lt;br /&gt;They arrived quickly, in great condition, and we now are on regular shipments of them. I felt ripped off. The photo clearly shows two bones and the price, at $8 plus, is indicative of two. I thought I was purchasing a "bone" packaged as two to a pack. Walmart sells identical big smoked knuckle bones for $3.50 ea. Why doesn\'t the photo show one bone instead of two if they are just shipping one? It wasn\'t worth the hassle to return the package to make my point of protest so I am doing it here.  Beartoothjoe Wow I heard of this candy but could never find it, now I am hooked. Now I don\'t have to suck on child lemons with salt, just shakey shakey. I absolutely love these! Seven of these sweet, very thin Graham Crisps are only 60 calories, but it\'s easy to eat a lot of them and there are almost 80 in the package. Delicious by themselves; wonderful with ice cream. If they are purchased using Amazon\'s Add-on Program there is no shipping charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I\'ve seen mixed reviews of this company\'s products. The items I\'ve purchased have not been stale or strange smelling. I love the 34 degree cracked peppercorn, wheat, and other varieties so I thought I would try the caramel, cinnamon, and graham as an alternative to cookies or regular graham crackers. True - you can have a lot of these crackers for little calories/carbs, but the flavor is bland. In terms of satisfaction, they don\'t quite cut it for me as a snack unless I put peanut butter or something on them. They would probably be good as part of a fruit and cheese dessert platter, along with some peanut butter, fruit spread, honey, or cream cheese. Is that these are 60 calories per serving, however, in all honesty, I didn\'t make it through a full serving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited about these, they looked like a "grown up graham cracker".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First problem was the smell. They smelled like melted plastic, and something else I\'d hesitate to even guess what it is, but it\'s bad. I bravely pulled out one small crisp, hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the ... aroma. It was not. The crisp itself smells horrific.&lt;br /&gt;I figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled.&lt;br /&gt;Second problem is that I was very, very wrong about that. They have a funky, chemical taste that just defies description. The aftertaste is sort of like a skunky/chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash/wet cardboard kinda taste. Seriously, it was awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tasted these about 45 minutes ago, and after drinking an entire bottle of water AND brushing my teeth, I CAN STILL TASTE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\'m glad these were an add-on, but they are still absolutely terrible. Their only redeeming quality is that they are cute. Not one single member of my family will actually eat them though, so this was definitely a waste of 3$. Had I known they would be this awful, I\'d have just got a second bag of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007POA158"&gt;Hi I\'m Skinny Sticks, Sweet Onion Multigrain, 7-Ounce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Only 30 cent more than these, but MILES better in taste. This soup is good. I really love this brand of soups..my favorite being the Chicken and Dumplings. Healthy Choice isn\'t always the best brand when it comes to frozen meals but for some reason they really knocked it out of the park with their soups. I love them, they taste homemade and amazingly better than Campbell\'s or Progresso. I recommend this, the Chicken and Dumplings, the Split Pea and Ham...in fact, every variety I\'ve tried has been delicious. You can\'t really go wrong with this. First, I agree with J. Bishop\'s (Houston, TX) review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not only the best flavor of the Healthy Choice soup line, it is clearly among the best canned soup flavors of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healthy Choice is the only brand of canned soup I buy on any regular basis.  It\'s the only brand that has never used MSG--a sure sign that a recipe lacks imagination (not too mention sodium issues).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish I could buy quantities of this in the microwave packaging (hard to find in stores)... a lifetime supply would do nicely. If you love vegetable soup you should like this. Yes it has come chicken and large noodle type items in it too.&lt;br /&gt;But it was not as good as I expected or hoped it would be I enjoyed this soup.  It was flavorful with a nice blend of spices.  I will buy it again. Tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups, and I like both the tomato and chicken broth varieties. Although I didn\'t expect freshly fried tortilla strips or queso fresco in a canned soup, I did expect something that resembled all other tortilla soups I have tried, that is a LIGHT broth with a mix of vegetables, corn, beans chicken and Mexican spices. This soup is thick - really thick, like the thickest tomato soup you\'ve ever had with a grilled cheese sandwich. It\'s also sweet, and does not taste in the least like a Mexican soup. Instead, imagine straight tomato soup with a bunch of vegetables, beans and some chicken thrown in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving it all away, and, to be fair, one of the people I gave the soup to said her husband really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a canned soup that much more closely resembles real tortilla soup, try &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014EUB7I"&gt;Campbell\'s Select Mexican Chicken Tortilla, 18.6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)&lt;/a&gt;. First off, there is a difference when you drink something out of box versus glass. A big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was strolling in my local health food store and saw that this product was being packaged in a bottle. I snatched that sucker off the shelf faster than you could blink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried this brand visiting a bigger city over a year ago. Only to find out when I got home that they didn\'t sell the canned version at my store. I was so bummed but not up for ordering cases of this stuff online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the other brands. This is by far the best. It could be because it\'s in a glass. I\'m not a high end taste tester but I just know there is a big difference. And this stuff is like wine...best served when chilled. So being in a glass bottle makes all the difference in the world. Guess you could make that analogy of boxed wined versus bottled. I\'ll always take bottle over boxed even if the box is more bang for your buck. I\'m a foodie. I love savoring food and beverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people are mentioning it\'s over priced. Compared to what? And if you notice it\'s not Amazon selling it, it\'s a distributor using Amazon as a portal to advertise and sell it. The free shipping is really put into the cost of the price of a case. They could reduce the price but then it would probably say $10-$15.00 for shipping. It really would not make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I\'m happy it\'s at my local health food store. I\'m not ready to buy this by the case. Woohoo. Thanks, Taste Nirvana. This really is "Happiness in a bottle." Go get your own. I\'m not sharing ;) This brand is a little hard to find in stores as i don\'t think it\'s carried by any of the major supermarket chains. I discovered it at Au Bon Pain and noticed that unlike other brands I\'ve tried, this one is not from concentrate and has nothing added, it\'s just pure unadultered coconut water, so the quality can\'t get much better. The other thing i really like about it is that it\'s a glass container rather than paper or plastic, so the taste is not compromised. These things alone are worth 5 stars to me but there are a couple things I would suggest to make it even better. First, this isn\'t really pulp the way you would think of it from you experience with fruit juices where there\'s pulverized, very small, drinkable pieces floating in the liquid; these are chunks of diced coconut that you have to chew up while drinking. To me, this would be fine if they were all the soft flesh you\'d expect from a young cocunut but many of the pieces are harder which is unpleasant in a drink. Second, 9.5 ounces doesn\'t go a long way, I\'d like to see it bumped up to at least a 12oz, I\'d then feel like I\'m getting an adequate amount for my money and it would last longer and quench better. If you like coconut water, then you will love Taste Nirvana!!! It has bits of coconut in it. Not just a few, it has a lot of little bits. this is great coconut water and there is no added sugar. its all natural and they use ripe coconut not young coconut. Pretty close to the taste of a freshly opened coconut.  I\'d like to know more about the process for obtaining this water to understand what the "natural coconut water" means.  The tasty juicy bits of pulp in the product add an extra complexity and make this a very refreshing beverage.  The fresh coconut is jelly like and not so pulpy, but it\'s still tasty. As far as taste goes, this is the best coconut water I\'ve tasted. I have not tried all the other brands, so I am only comparing this to coconut water ordered at restaurants (which I think is usually sweetened, so it really isn\'t a fair comparison), Vitacoco, and Amy and Brian\'s. Vitacoco uses Brazilian coconuts while Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian\'s use Thai coconuts. It seems like Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian\'s are naturally sweeter than Vitacoco, with Taste Nirvana being the sweetest. This is a good sweet though, since all of these three brands have no sugars added. While I\'ve liked all the coconut water I\'ve tasted, Vitacoco can have a slightly more salty and less sweet taste, while Taste Nirvana has an amazing taste with just the right amount of sweetness. I liked the pulp as well, although some of the pieces seem to be from more mature coconuts rather than the young almost gelatin pulps I\'m used to at some restaurants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I took a star off is due to the price. These 9.5 oz bottles are not the most economical way to buy Taste Nirvana. In fact, at the current price this costs as much as I paid at the coffee shop for individual bottles. For the best bargain on this brand, buy &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OW342G"&gt;Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp, 16.2-Ounce (Pack of 12)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try this brand because a lot of people say Taste Nirvana or Amy and Brian\'s taste the best, and I\'d have to give my vote to Taste Nirvana. Hopefully some day I will taste a fresh coconut and maybe that will get my vote, but if you\'re like me and don\'t have any coconut trees nearby, try this out. Enjoy! This is my favorite coconut water! Having traveled in Asia and being able to get someone to climb a tree to harvest a coconut and then open it with a machete, nothing I found in the store came close... until I found Taste Nirvana. The other brands are mostly from Brazilian coconuts, whereas this brand uses Thailand coconuts and it makes a difference.  Truly happiness in a bottle. It\'s a little pricey, but I can\'t get enough! I had coconut trees growing in my backyard in Southeast Asia, and enjoyed drinking coconut water right from the coconut itself. Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water with Pulp is the closest to the real thing that I\'ve found. IMHO. There is simply not a better beverage on Earth. Since I need to add  some more words see prior sentence. Coconut water should not be sweetened!!! Actually "NO SUGAR SHOULD EVER BE ADDED" sweeting things is an american custom, which ruins the real flavor of coconut water. I lived in Jamaica for 4 years and the bahamas for 2, and the coconut water from real coconut does not have any added sugar, its natural.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick to buying the brown hard shell coconuts from the supermarket and drink that it\'s more natural and unaltered. These boxed, caned and packaged coconut water are nasty, i am still yet to try a brand, one of the many that i have tried that will make me wanna buy it. This will ruin supermarket mustard for you. High quality and just the right amount of bite so it allows the food to shine through. I have tasted one too many different mustards which claim to be spicy, but fall short.  This spreads easy and is neither too thick, nor too thin.  It actually does have enough heat to taste, without being excessive.  This mustard would make a great addition to any sauces, marinades, salad dressings, or just for dipping!  I would recommend this product, for anyone who is looking for a mustard with some true heat. A very tasty little cake. The cake was surprisingly moist, and the caramel rum sauce was very sweet but not too overpowering. We\'ll definitely be buying this product again. The cake was a little smaller than I thought, but it was delicious.  My husband and I enjoyed it so much, we are ordering more for Christmas! This tea actually tastes the way a rose smells.  It\'s like sipping on roses when you drink it.  I\'m glad it can be purchased on Amazon because I looked in every regular food store as well as the more unusual stores, like Trader Joes, that carry unusual food items and could not find it. It says Habenero peppers on the ingredients, but my guess is they just waved it over the closed bottle. Smells like molasses and soy sauce. Taste like molasses and soy sauce. Absolutely boring. Great sauce! Used in many Jamaican restaurants to help with the heat of the jerk seasoning. Most use Walkerwood jerk seasoning to make the jerk and pour this on later on the jerk or the rice. Tastes too sweet, which Jerk Seasoning is not.  Walker\'s woods is the most authentic to taste.  This was a waste. I thought I would try this, but I am sticking with my UNCLE JOES JERK SAUCE!!! This is sweet &amp; not hot....should be hot if they are going to put jerk on the label Received order within 7 business days.  The product received did not have the same label as pictured though the wording was the same.  Also the product did not have the same flavor as the product pictured (which we had bought previously locally).  I suppose the manufacturer has not only changed the label for this product, but also the recipe.  The distributor provided excellent service and we have decided to keep the sauce we received, just have to make our own modifications for our grilled vegetable recipe we have used in the past.  Thanks for another great distributor for the products we like.&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZFQ"&gt;World Harbors Jamican Style Jerk Sauce, 16-Ounce Bottle, (Pack of 6)&lt;/a&gt; I LOVE this sauce! It is sweet and molasses-y, with a tiny kick of heat.  I use it to make Hawaiian chicken or pork all the time.  I\'ve never had authentic Jamaican jerk, so I can\'t vouch for accuracy there, but my whole family loves this one :D I love this sauce! I used to get it at my local grocery store, but they\'ve stopped selling it. I just ordered a six pack and it\'s going to last a good long while. Most people I know that have tried this don\'t like it, but I find the taste sweet and kind of zippy at the same time. I have been trying to find a substitute for months! I\'m so glad I found this on Amazon! :) We used to buy this sauce at our local grocery store which closed in September.  Luckily, we were able to find it at Amazon.  You do have to buy a 6-pack but the expiration date is March 2012.  Habanero Peppers give it a kick even though it has no onions.  I\'m allergic to onions so this is a welcome product.  Very hard to find any good sauce with no onions. This sauce has just the right combination of sweet, spicy and mild heat that is perfect for using with a family.  The spicy isn\'t overpowered with allspice, the way some other brands are.  Baste this on grilled pineapple for Jerk Turkey Burgers and you\'ll be in love too!  My only trouble is finding it in our small town stores... have had to go to the internet, but it\'s worth it. (First of all, somebody is chasing me around and negging all my review so dont pay any&lt;br /&gt;attention to those NO votes, they both arrived within minutes of posting this review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sickly sweetish molasses flavored thing is NOT jerk sauce, doesnt even remotely&lt;br /&gt;resemble a bad facsimile. I dont know what World Harbors is thinking, cause this stuff&lt;br /&gt;is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I like their Teriyaki sauce, but this..... its as bad as it gets. It\'s not great plain, but it\'s wonderful mixed with other herbs.  It can be a little bland if you don\'t put anything but the rosehips in the infuser.  Hibiscus goes great with it, though.  It\'s a great tea for children because it\'s mild and fruity, for adults add it to something else.&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can eat the rosehips after they\'ve been brewed, sounds weird but they are great, they taste a little bit like an apple and have lots of vitamin C.  Watch out for the pith (that\'s the best word I can think of for the little hairlike thorns that surround the seeds), though, if you decide to eat the hips.  Every once in a while you find one that hasn\'t been de-pithed properly, hence you need to avoid the pith if you eat the brewed hips. These cloves are very finely ground and extremely pungent. I use them in cooking, I let a small amount soak in coconut oil and use it for massage oil, and also mix it straight into beeswax for candles. It works well on all counts. I am very satisfied and will be reordering when needed. This mix is probably not something you would want to use everyday.  Its just new enough and different enough to be something special to add to your summertime recipe\'s.  When you want to reward yourself with something fun and fruity, this can fill the bill quickly and easily.  It has no aftertaste so often associated with diet drinks.  I highly recommend it. When I opened the package, I expect the same old tasting Beef Jerky but my taste buds surprised me.  This beef jerky tastes amazing! I\'ve been buying products from Amazon.com for years was really inspired to leave any feedback but as soon as I tasted this Beef Jerky, I wanted everyone to know.  I just ordered 5 more :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Baba Ali this is the best halal beef jerky i have ever tasted. also the company truly gives an Orthodox Muslim a good choice in buying because when you call them to ask about their slaughtering process they quickly give you the answer unlike other Muslim company\'s who try do deceive the consumer. I am not Muslim, but was interested in this jerky because of its low carb content compared to some other brands of "sweet" jerky out there.  It has a slightly sweet taste and great flavor (spicy...but NOT hot)!  It is easy to chew and doesn\'t leave your fingers sticky. I wish it came in more economical sizes (6, 9, or 12 oz sizes), but that doesn\'t seem to be the case.  It\'s a great jerky and might just be addictive, which probably makes the 3 ounces bag size a good choice...after the first 3 ounces you HAVE TO STOP (at least long enough to open another bag)!!! Well, after trying a lot of brands, this is probably the best beef jerky I ever tasted! Great product and it tastes great.  I keep a bag in my drawer at work in case I get hungry and its great to eat to keep my protein count high since I\'m working out. These are very tasty, but way too sweet &amp; sugary.  I felt like I was eating candy instead of meat.  If that\'s okay with you, then you\'ll probably love these, but I was looking for something a bit healthier.  Yes, I know it says \'sweet\' in the product name, but I bought it because of the no hormone, no antibiotic, no artificial ingredient aspect. Never had jerky before because I\'ve never seen a Halal version. Was a little apprehensive at first but found it highly addictive. Went through a whole bag in one sitting. I recommend all my curious Muslim brothers and sisters to try it. amazing taste, incredible quality. This is the best beef jerky I have ever had. I think it\'s even better than the other non-halal ones. This beef jerky made me leave my first review ever on amazon though I\'m a regular costumer of theirs. Thumbs up! I don\'t eat chips often, but when I do, these are some of my favorites. They have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips, but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special. The lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been dusted on. Some chips seem to have barely any flavor and I find myself looking for those with the most. Still, none of them have quite enough for my tastes. I wish that these chips had more that just a "hint" of lime. Product arrived on time, nicely packaged and gift wrapped, the treats were all quality and very good.  Nice keepsake box. I got these for my mom who is always sucking on a cough drop. These are gummi and are minty like a cough drop, she really likes them. A unique gummi creation. This oil is wonderful. I\'ve had almond oil that was so strong it overwhelmed what I was using it for (salad, cooking).  I loved the flavor of this oil and will be buying more. I wanted to love this because I LOVE Earl Grey tea, I NEED decaf and I ADORE the convenience of the Keurig.  Unfortunately, I don\'t love these.  The flavor is very weak and doesn\'t deliver on the aroma.  I typically use the large cup setting on the 3-size model, but even the small cup is wimpy with these.  I did find that mixing this one with a stronger-flavored decaf tea results in a more suitable strength, but then you have to make 2 cups of something. The English Breakfast decaf is a much better choice. As someone who goes through lots of thyme (I use it in everything except cereal), I was pleasantly surprised to see this product on Amazon at a very reasonable price. Looks, smells and tastes just like any other thyme but you can not beat not running to the grocery store and paying about 5-10x more for a tiny bottle which would last maybe 2 weeks in my house :). Good product and reasonable price compared with local store. For people who use it everyday, it\'s a great deal... I would recommend it to everyone who loves thyme flavor. I have purchased several herbs from Frontier which have been of good quality.  Thyme leaf is always one of the most difficult to purchase due to the likely chance of recieving more stem than leaf.  This thyme leaf purchase was of average to good quality.  I did have about 30-70%, stem to leaf cut in the package, so I was satified with the selection.  When I dry my own thyme leaf, I usually do about the same or a little less stem to leaf ratio for cooking use.  Stem of the thyme leaf are just as favorable as the leaf and can be used to cook with successfully. I was reading a news story about how lab research suggest a thyme tincture to be one of the most effective ways to fight acne (better than a prescription). I got 5 quart jars (this amount is perfect for that many), 2 cheap bottles of vodka (80 proof) filled each jar half way with thyme then topped it off with the vodka. I\'m still letting it sit (it takes six weeks) before it will be complete. where I will then have to get cheese cloth and separate the thyme from the liquid and do a test run. I\'ll update with results mid-may I use a lot of various spices in my cooking and wanted to find a source with a quality product at a reasonable price.  Frontier met that discription. This is the best olive oil not for cooking as any olive oil will work the flavor and aroma is fantastic Brings you to Italy Use on salads breads for dipping. this item came exactly as described and shipped on time which is very important for Christmas!!  Thanks for a reliable, easy shopping experience. I brought some of this back from a trip to Jamaica and wished I had bought it by the gallon.  It is very hard to find but WELL worth ordering in bulk!  It is a sweet but spicy sauce that takes me back to Jamaica with every taste.  I have attempted to duplicate it many times but can\'t seem to get it right.  I am ecstatic to finally have found a source. I bought this on a whim and wow do I consider myself lucky.  It was a shot in the dark, but this turned out to be one of the best hot sauces I have ever tasted.  Not only has some good spicy heat, but excellent flavor as well.  It\'s an unexpected mix of heat with a hint of sweet, and a very robust mix of spices.  One thing I really love about it is that it flavors whatever you put it on, but does not overwhelm it.  The heat is hot for sure, but doesn\'t linger for very long.  The flavor is very original.  I went back to Amazon and bought a whole case of it. I love jerk cooking, and this is the perfect jerk sauce to put over a freshly cooked piece of jerk chicken, pork, goat or beef. Each bottle does not last long at our house. Pamela\'s makes an awesome, delicious, easy to use wheatfree baking mix.  The 25 lb bag is clearly a wholesale product, coming in a brown paper bag without any fancy labels.  In January Amazon was selling this product for $66 which was clearly an appropriate price for a wholesale item, especially if you compared it to the other sizes of the same baking mix.  Now they are charging $82 for the exact same product which makes it MORE expensive than buying the same product offered as 3 of the 4 lb bags in the very pretty retail packaging.  Something isn\'t right with this product offer, anymore.  Shame on you Amazon.  You\'re supposed to be above such schemes!&lt;br /&gt;STILL, swear by Pamela\'s wheatfree Baking &amp; Pancake Mix.  It\'s the BEST. Pamela\'s all purpose mix is exactly what the gluten free folk out there need. It\'s like using regular white flour in almost everything. Every time I make a cookie, muffin, pancake, baked good, white sauce, etc it always turns out amazing! I have been using this product for at least 16 years. I only went gluten free about 2 years ago, but I used Pamela\'s products before going GF because I liked the taste of them! I love Pamelas Baking Mix.  The 25 lb bag is quite large and the expiration is March 2, 2010, only 4 months after my purchase. I will never be able to use that much baking mix in such a short amount of time.  Not worth it. What can I say about this flour that won\'t make it look like I was paid to say it?  I have been using this flour since I was diagnosed with Celiac disease six years ago. I have worked as a gluten free lifestyle coach for GF diagnosed people for years helping them to adjust to the diet and Pamela\'s flour is one of the first things I steer them to.  It is a great all-around gluten free flour.  It is not too light, like rice flour and not too heavy like a bean flour.  It does substitute well in all of my recipes.  It\'s baking outcome is very desireable.  I have never had trouble with it. In fact, many times the comments I get on my baked goods from my non-GF friends is that they can\'t tell it\'s gluten free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to  be fair, I need to mention that it does have dairy and nuts in it.  This is a problem for dairy and nut allergy persons and children.  This is the ONLY drawback I see in this product.  Unfortunately, I have not found something that I like as well to substitute for it. I am so excited about this product.  I have made Paula Dean\'s Apple Cake (half of the glaze), pancakes, Thanksgiving dressing, muffins and cornbread using this gf baking mix in place of the plain flour, salt and baking powder.  They were excellent.  My non gf family enjoyed them tremendously.  The finished products were not gravely or grainy. The taste was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never tried this, test it out in the much smaller size.  It is wonderful. I have a cafe in Talent , Oregon.  I couldnt find this product wholesale anywhere. This is so convienient and free shipping and it was here in just a few days!!  My supplier could only get small amounts of inferior product and it would take 3 weeks. Thanks Amazon! You can exchange this baking mix for regular flour in almost any recipe.  Also makes yummy pancakes and waffles! My wife has Celiac Sprue which is a Allergy to Gluten in certain grains. She was diagnosed with this disease about 8 years ago. When she was first diagnosed, we could only purchase Gluten Free products from health food stores and it was very expensive. As awareness about this disease has spread more companies are offering Gluten free products. In our search we stumbled across Pamela\'s. My wife fell instantly in love with it. The pancakes made from this flour are indistinguishable from wheat flour. We made the jump and now the whole family is eating Pamela\'s. To purchase it at the store is rather expensive. Did a web search and found it reasonably priced at Amazon. We will continue to purchase Pamela\'s in bulk until it is no longer offered. Great Pancakes! Growing up with wheat, I had an aversion to gluten free (GF) products but when my daughter exhibited sensitivities to gluten we thought we\'d give this a try.  Both my wife and I were amazed at the waffles.  I typically made waffles from scratch but using this mix also saves a lot of time - just add eggs, water, &amp; oil.  The subscribe and save 25-pound bag is the best value (with free shipping), we will store unused product sealed in the freezer. I keep Pamela\'s baking mix in a 7 gallon container with a spin-on bucket seal lid in the pantry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I want to make pancakes or waffles to start the day right I take a cup or two of mix, add a teaspoon of Vanilla extract, an egg and olive oil and I\'m ready to go.  What I enjoy most about purchasing the 25 lb bag is that it is easy to store and keeps fresh for months, yet is accessible and consistent in performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a special treat I like to add hemp seed on the top of the waffles during cooking and fresh blueberries and strawberries before topping off with Agave Syrup. This is our second time purchasing the 25lb bag of Pamela\'s pancake and baking mix.  Last time it came with a label with baking instructions, but this time it didn\'t.  Good thing I had cut off my label and put it in the bucket with the pancake mix.  But other than that, this mix couldn\'t be more perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Since being diagnosed celiac and trying to balance gluten free/gluten eating in the same kitchen with 7 people, we opted to move everyone gluten free at home.  This mix is a godsend and seriously, it tastes remarkable!!  It is a real time saver and what we do instead of drive thru windows, these days.  I make a bunch and keep them in the freezer so they can be pulled out, toasted and made into a quick PB&amp;J for the kids.  I am so grateful to be able to purchase this is bulk as it makes GF eating much easier for our above average family size and keeps my kitchen GF!! We use this flour for pancakes, muffins, biscuits and more.  I have found that this mix works great in all my old regular bisquick recipes.  We find the flavor to be similar to wheat flour.  We have subbed this flour into several wheat flour cookie recipes, leaving out the leavening called for, and only one has turned out unsatisfactorily, but not inedible.  Definitely convenient and more affordable to our family of seven to be able to purchase in bulk. We go through Pamela\'s like crazy.  Fantastic for pancakes (we like to add a little vanilla to batter).  It also makes great chocolate chip cookies and banana bread.  The 25 lb bag is definately the best way to go value wise. My family and I are relatively new to gluten free and we have been in search of a baking mix to replace our weekend breakfasts.  We have tried several others and they all taste "gluten free", if you know what I mean.  Pamela\'s however, is so good and you can\'t tell its gluten free. Try it, you won\'t regret it! This is exactly what I wanted. It is much cheaper to buy it this way and not through a store. Thank you so much!! I\'m new to the gluten free diet and this is perfect!! The product arrived undamaged just as it was described on the website. No delays and arrived quickly. The customer was satisfied with the quality and arrival of order. When you have health issues taking Gluten out of your diet is a good way to start, it may be the source of your problem, it has been in my case, and using Pamela\'s Products has helped me get on the right track to feeling better. What\'s not to like about Pamela\'s baking mix? I use it as a base for a number of baked goods. I have made biscotti - and a wonderful Lemon Ricotta cake with Pamela\'s  to name just a  couple of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a little carried away with the last purchase - I bought the 25 pound bag -which means I won\'t have to order it again for a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that area curious about the Pamela\'s Baking Mix - it\'s a wonderful tasty base mix. The waffles and pancakes it makes are delightful - I really cannot say another bad about the baking mix nor Amazon for bringing the larger bag option to us - the consumer. I\'ve tried tons of GF pancake mixes.  I could choke on most of them or just decide not to ever eat pancakes again.  These are so moist and delicious.  My 92 year old grandmother was just diagnosed with celiac disease.  She loves them too.  My wife and children who are not GF also love them.&lt;br /&gt;m It\'s hard to find quality gf products, and pamela\'s doesn\'t dissapoint. I always recommend this. I go through a lot of this blend with a family of five. Amazon helps keep it more affordable. The pancakes are great and the waffles are really good. I haven\'t tried it with much else yet, but my sister-in-law does chocolate scones  frequently  with great raves. I use the bread mix also all the time, and am very pleased with both. I started eating these after reading Esselstyn\'s popular book on heart disease (heal through eating oatmeal).  There\'s no way I can choke down cooked oat meal; eating oatmeal cookies, on the other hand, is something I can swallow.  All of Erin Baker\'s cookies appear to be made with oatmeal, and the three that I\'ve tried are palatable enough.  Nevertheless, the Fruit &amp; Nut flavor was the one flavor of the three that I most looked forward to savoring each morning (I hope it wasn\'t because of lower oatmeal content than the other three).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, you don\'t have to be the Cookie Monster to like these. Nor do you--despite the "Fruit &amp; Nut" flavor--have to be a little "fruity" (to quote Norman Bates\' audible thoughts in Hitchcock\'s "Psycho") or a "health nut" to find these tasty and nutritious--maybe even therapeutic (Dr. Esselstyn would seem to think so). And the advantage of the "mini" size is that you might feel better--less guilty, at least--about knocking off two instead of just one cookie at a time. I like them as a midmorning snack with a cup of coffee.  They are also great for those mornings you really aren\'t in the mood for breakfast, but know you\'ll be hungry later.  They seem to keep you satisfied for an hour or two.  They do taste great - not too sweet and not overly cake-like.  Buy a bunch and keep them in the freezer until you need more. If you want a quick pick me up in a small package, each one individually wrapped this is my choice! I have one in the car mid compartment, and in my briefcase they would be great and a pre aerobic workout snack. Great flavor, moist &amp; not too sweet. Beware if you are allergic to nuts-these are out. I took them out of the box and divided into zip lock bags and froze. When I needed more I just pulled one bag from the freezer and it worked out great. Breakfast cookies are a favorite with the young children (ages 6 and 9) of a friend.  These one-ounce cookies are the right size for young children.  The are individually wrapped, and can be used at home or as a take along snack item.  They can also be used as special treats on occasions like Halloween. Erin Baker\'s products are a favorite for my family.  The breakfast cookie mini\'s are great for snacks &amp; coffee breaks and especially good for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;This is a denser product than a regular cookie, nice and chewy and filling with only 100 calories. My kids (4yrs and 1 1/2yrs) love these cookies, much to my surprise!  The mini ones are just right for them and I\'m happy to give them \'cookies\' for breakfast!  There are 2 things I don\'t like:  1) The individual cookie packages are VERY hard to open...I always need scissors and 2) the cookies fall-apart easily...I wouldn\'t recommend passing these out in the car!&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product and I purchased these in bulk so we are sure to always have them on hand. We LOVE Erin Baker\'s Breakfast Cookies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the small mini\'s are the first time that we have had a problem (PROBLEM) with about 1/3 of them being moldy or having mold on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storage has not been an issue.  When we got them (within 1/2 an hour), they were placed into the freezer until use.  As we use the cookies we take them from the freezer to the microwave (for a quick warm-up).  However, still I am fearful each time I rip into a small package, that I will find mold either on the top or sides of the cookie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, obviously, not conducive to enjoyment while eating them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have NEVER had this problem with any of the the big cookie variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE:**  02/15/12  - Today I opened my door to find a box sent to me from Erin Baker\'s... and it had 2 boxes of fresh double chocolate chunk minis (the exact amount that I had found to be moldy in my original order).  AMAZING company.  Check out the comments attached to my review to see how this all came about.  TOP MARKS to this company.  Not only fabulous breakfast cookies, but amazing customer service (which THEY volunteered - I did NOT ask for!!!) These are not awful if eaten with a cup of tea, coffee or milk -- but they are very dry if eaten plain.  I do like how they have less sugar than most granola bars and are not a choking hazard for toddlers like hard snacks can sometimes be.  I am a fan of the oatmeal raisin mini cookies, and of the regular size EB cookies, but this flavor tastes very fruity to me and not very chocolaty.  I think the double choc cherry tastes better than these.  Happy to have them for last resort snack-on-the-go needs, but not my favorite. I was expecting hard tasteless healthy cookies.  It is soft, a little chewy and yummy.  Very tasty. These are excellent. They taste great and are just the right size.  Two can make an on the go breakfast that is tasty and good for you.  The larger size breakfast cookies are just too big. 2 of these are perfect.  My husband had gotten out of the habit of eating breakfast- too much trouble- but since I bought these he is good about grabbing one or two on the way out the door. I love these cookies and I love Erin as a result. These cookies make me smile. The texture makes my eyes googly. The smell reminds me of beautiful spring days and how awesome it\'d be to spend them with Erin, have her bring the fresh cookies out of the oven and us enjoying them together on our outdoor swing listening to the birds and enjoying the creek that passed through our backyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that this kind and the other kind (raisin) don\'t differ much in taste. They both taste the same--taste of Heaven. I live in the area where these cookies are made, and I remember buying them from local coffee stands when they first started making them years ago -- each one was wrapped in saran wrap and had a handwritten label on them.  The packaging has changed, and there are many different flavors available now, but the original breakfast cookie still tastes just as good today as those first ones did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller size is great for a snack, as the large ones are enough for two people!  Full of good stuff, not too sweet...it\'s a treat that you can feel good about. ERIN BAKER\'S ORGANIC BREAKFAST COOKIES ARE DELICIOUS AND MOIST. I AM TRULEY ENJOYING THEM.  EACH COOKIE IS INDIVIDUALLY PACKAGED. THERE GREAT FOR THROWING IN YOUR LUNCH, WORK, SCHOOL OR DRIVING ON A TRIP. ALTHOUGH, SHE MAKES DIFFERENT KINDS I FIND THE FRUIT &amp; NUT IS A FAVORITE. SO IF YOU LIKE A OATMEAL COOKIE THAT\'S WHOLESOME, DELIICOUS, &amp; MOIST THEN THIS IS THE ONE. IT\'S A WINNER!!! Of the Erin Baker products, the Fruit &amp; Nut Mini Breakfast Cookie is my favorite!  I have one mini breakfast cookie (about 100 calories) with a cup of coffee in the morning and I feel satisfied and ready to start the day.  Very healthy, low in caloreis, and super delicious is what makes the product work for me.  Try it, you\'ll like it. If you are looking for a rich chocolate cookie look somewhere else.  But if you are looking for a fairly good tasting 100 calorie breakfast or snack these are pretty good. My kids love these, and we\'ve ordered them often - but as was the case with at least one other reviewer, this batch came in with some mold. (I freeze them as soon as they arrive, so had the have been moldy upon arrival.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;too bad - but at this price, won\'t run the risk of having to toss out product. I\'ve been having these cookies for about 4 years, and l love it, but  I can not find them, in the store where I used to buy, I live in San Diego, so I would like to buy them here, thaks. I started out thinking they were OK, a little more substance than the breakfast bar from Whole Foods.  But after I ordered a 12-pack (I didn\'t realize it was 12 boxes of 8), and had eaten them for a couple of weeks as I was flying out the door, I realized they were not really very tasty and kind of dry. If you want to treat your tastebuds to the ultimate delight, try dulce de leche and this brand is the best! As a native of Argentina, I grew up with this stuff and no imitation comes close. Serve it inside crepes slightly warm folded and with powder sugar, with flan or ice cream and remember a little goes a long way. Very sweet! A friend brought me this from Argentina and my kids and I ate it with a spoon and then apples so that I would feel less guilty. When we finished, I immediately panicked because I wasn\'t sure if I could get it here in the U.S. Low and behold I found it on Amazon. It is different packaging but same company so I assume it is just catering to Americans. Delicious! I think this is the best Dulce de Leche I ever tried.  I discovered at the Llao Llao hotel in Bariloche (Argentina) on a recent trip.  They serve it at breakfast there. Just an outstanding product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An authentic dulce de leche ranked number-one in Argentina for its exceptional richness and depth of flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made at a small dairy outside of Buenos Aires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(note that the web page or supplier indicates "Made in Spain" but this product is clearly made in Argentina) I was born in Argentina and this is a top of the line dulce de leche, to eat with toasts or as add-on to cakes (comparable to Chimbote).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I noticed that dulce de leche is an acquired taste. So unless you grew up eating it, you may consider dulce de leche to be a little too sweet. My father grew up in Argentina and since he came to the States has been searching for the perfect dulce de leche that reminded him of his childhood. He doesn\'t have to search anymore, I bought him a couple of jars this past Christmas and he has been a happy camper ever since. We used to have a pipeline to get homemade dulce de leche from a bonafide Argentine, but alas, said pipeline moved away.  This is the next best thing and doesn\'t involve me hanging out in the kitchen for hours while my milk caramelizes. I am so glad I ordered this; it is the best dulce de leche I have been able to find. I had read about this somewhere and am now convinced that many people are not familiar with this product. If you like anything caramel, you\'ll love this! Very high quality dulce de leche from Argentina. Compared to most brands, it\'s a bit lighter colored, and the taste is more subdued and milkier. You may or may not appreciate this, as it\'s not the classic taste that you expect from commercial dulce de leche, but it\'s by far the closest to the homemade dulce that my grandma used to make. For this, I\'d give it 6 stars if I could! I bought this for my girlfriend as she had been having tummy issues and she absolutely loves it.  Now it seems assumed I will keep her in stock.  That alludes to a completely different product review.  The point is, buying it in bulk grants the obvious versatility of making tea bags when on the go or strainers when home.  It seems very economical without sacrificing quality in the least.  My only wish is that they would institute the subscribe and save feature here for those who are hooked and are loyal customers.  My GF usually gets what she wants. This is a good quality product, which definitely helps tame my tummy.  I have it each evening and it makes a huge difference in how I feel.  Definitely recommended, along with Heather\'s Acacia Fiber, which is life-changing. I wasn\'t much of a tea drinker until I bought a \'Breville\' automatic tea maker and a bag of Tummy Tea Fennel for my wife. She started brewing the first pot of this new tea and did it ever smell great- a little like licorice. We both shared that pot and have been hooked ever since. This is one of those teas that makes you just feel warm and fuzzy all over. It is a feeling you do not forget.  If I was stranded on a desert island and could only have one tea this would be it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  For those who enjoy drinking tea I would encourage you to look into the \'Breville\' tea maker. Produced by a German firm it is without a doubt an indispensible tool for brewing tea. The price for this mechanical marvel is a little high but believe me it is worth every penny. I love tea, hot or cold, and am always looking to try new ones. This tea brews up a wonderful cup - just opening the bag to scoop some out is a joy. The smell alone is captivating. I tried a cup to relieve a stomach ache and it relieved my discomfort immediately. It really does taste just like good quality licorice and it\'s naturally sweet. When my urge for sweets hits, I can now reach for this tea instead and it really does satisfy my cravings. This tea will be a staple in my pantry. I think this is a really good deal. I seal it up in a rubbermaid container and just scoop it out to brew. Good stuff! Live with digestive problems, and you eat a lot of mint: mint lozenges, mint tea, and those \'curiously strong\' mints.  You can get tired of the taste of mint.  Especially in the morning.  I gave up coffee months ago, (and I still whimper some mornings), so I\'m looking for some kind of substitute.  Forget decaf anything.  Forget chocolate.  Forget tea.  Some people swear by hot water with lemon. I don\'t. Too acid.  This fennel tea sells elsewhere as \'tummy tamer tea.\' It does.  It\'s better than chamomile tea, which doesn\'t do much for me in terms of flavor or calming anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\'ve used this fennel tea in desperation those mornings when nothing else will settle in.  When even mint leaves or herbal teabags of mint leaves are too much, this goes down nicely.  But if you\'re not a fan of vegetable soup or celery, this might take a little getting used to. Me, I like it. The smell reminds me of hops. The fennel smells fresh, tastes good, and makes a great addition to one of my tea blends. It is packaged exactly as shown in the picture. Came in a timely manner. Thanks! I love gummy bears. Love. I also love to eat healthy, and for me that means avoiding corn syrup whenever possible. I was sent these gummy bears by accident when I ordered the sour gummy bears (also by Surf Sweets) and I am glad I was, as these are absolutely delicious. They have the same texture as regular gummy bears, though if you let them warm up a little bit or get an off batch they may be a little bit chewier.  Some find them a little bit sweeter than regular gummy bears, but I think that is due to the lack of corn syrup. I don\'t really notice any difference. Note that these do still contain gelatin, so vegans should NOT eat this (I think that their jelly beans and the gummy worms are safe for vegans). The natural fruit juice flavors are delicious, and the fact that you get your vitamin C as well is just an added bonus. I would definitely recommend these, though I suggest you get these small bags over the large ones as otherwise you might find yourself eating the whole thing in one go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last caveat - if you are on a budget I suggest you go with the Surf Sweets Sour Gummy Bears (also available on Amazon) as they are ten dollars cheaper. I\'m still unsure of the reason for the price difference, but if you\'re on a budget the other ones are great too! These are guaranteed to be a hit with my kids -&lt;br /&gt;Like regular gummy bears, but even better - with extra flavor.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect consistency....Not too chewy... great all the way around. My four kids LOVE these, it\'s great that there\'s zero nasty stuff in it like grocery store \'fruit\' (ie total chemical junk) snacks. A \'safe\' kid snack! These are always delicious &amp; a much healthier alternative to most candies/ kid\'s sugary snacks. The size is perfect for goodie bags &amp; even fits in large Easter eggs. I found these little awesomely delicious fruit snacks at a gluten free show in Wisconsin.The guy that was there offered me a package and I fell in love!They are organic, which makes them all the more cool, and they are very, Very tasty!I looked on the ingredients and was surprised to find no high fructose corn syrup!They\'re a little chewy at first, but I can not find anything else wrong with them. They are a wonderful fruit snack that I don\'t feel guilty about eating afterwards! My 18 month old grandson only eats organic foods, and I was looking for a treat to give him when he visits. He loves these candies, and I don\'t feel too guilty because they are in a tiny packet with only a few in each one. They stay at Grandma\'s and Grandpa\'s house! (Of course we brush his teeth afterwards.) You cant go wrong with Rosa Monte Especial! this is one of the best yerbas in Argentina. Go for it. Seller did everything ok, in time and etc.! I switched to mate from coffee a few years ago. I know it\'s generally an afternoon drink, but I drink it in the morning like coffee. There were a couple of websites where I bought it regularly. Unfortunately, Dr. Oz saw fit to publicly endorse it as a health tea, and the price went up everywhere, including my regular sellers. So I went looking, and found this on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite brand. The Selecci&amp;oacute;n Especial is aged two years in special wooden boxes with vents to let smoke in. This is "elaborada con palo", meaning that it has stem bits in it, which makes the flavor last longer for more refills. Some will prefer "sin palo"(without stems), because the stems also add a little bitterness to the mate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that in Argentina, where mate is a common as coffee is here, Rosamonte is generally regarded as one of the best commercially available mate brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of this seller in particular, I can say that they were prompt, and that the box came with a couple free samples of flavored mate. A lot of people will prefer the flavored kinds, especially either "citron" which is lemon, or "hierbes de monta&amp;ntilde;a", which means moutain herbs and tastes like mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, however, prefer this for day-to-day consumption. I run plain water through the coffee-maker, fill a large coffee cup about 1/3 full with mate, and just keep topping it up with hot water for a couple hours as I sip it through the bombilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing that pleased me about this merchant is that the product was considerably less dusty than what I had been getting from my previous suppliers. The difference is probably about handling and storage. The bags are like a bag of sugar, and a lot of rough handling could crush the leaves inside, creating dust. In the mate, dust gets through the holes in the bombilla and coats your tongue, tastes a little bitter, and generally degrades the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it first arrived, I opened a bag and poured it into a big tupperware container that I use to store it. And I immediately noticed that there was very little dust compared to what I had been getting when I ordered this from my old seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\'m very happy with what I received. Packages came in soft container that had been crushed and one was split open.  I was worried about how fresh it would be but its aged so no worries.  The Mate is flavorful and strong.  I don\'t have much to compare it too but at $30.00 for 3 kilos (6.6 lbs) it seems to be a fantastic deal with a a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Organic, kind of a bummer, but pretty much expected.  I would get this again but I will probably try another more expensive, organic version and see if I can taste any difference. Rosamonte Especial can never let you down. Tastes fresh and strong. I smell Argentina in every sip. Yerba mate is going through an increase in prices, almost double..crazy. But it\'s worth the value. I will never change Rosamonte ESPECIAL! If you\'re setting out a whole can at once or transferring some of it to a container for later use, flip the can over and use a can opener to remove the bottom of the can. You can then pop the top of the can, releasing the vacuum holding the food in place and the whole thing will slide out cleanly. Much easier and tidier than scraping out the can with a spoon! I\'ve been feeding Wellness grain free for a couple years now with great results for my 3 cats. I believe the cost of a top quality food is well worth it in healthy, happy cats and reduced vet bills, but still the cost of Wellness has been prohibitive. I was excited to see Felidae had a grain free formula in the larger sized cans, and for a much lower price, so I am trying it. Just switched them over this week, so far so good. The bowls have been licked clean, and while I questioned the whole peas when I saw them, they weren\'t left in the bowl. The ingredients and quality of the Felidae seems comparable to the Wellness, so unless I find information indicating otherwise (and I\'ve been looking), I think we\'ll stick with Felidae. I\'ve been on the hunt for high quality, yet affordable cat food for my little ones the past few months. I decided to order a case of Felidae (along with a case of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK8B8W"&gt;Pet Guard Fish, Chicken &amp; Liver Food for Cats&lt;/a&gt;). Well, they love the Petguard but absolutely hate the Felidae, all three of them sniffed/licked it and looked at me like "you\'re kidding..right?" Even mixing in some of their old food and gradually trying to change them over wouldn\'t work, they\'d sniff it and walk off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They LOVE the Petguard though and will inhale it the second I put it on their plates, so at least I discovered one good food they\'ll eat. I guess I\'ll donate the 8 cans of Felidae I have left to the local shelter. Despite the fact my cats wouldn\'t eat it I still gave it 3 stars because it IS a great quality food...if your cats will eat it. I have 5 house cats.  One was recently diagnosed with diabetes.  We got his diabetes under control with insulin but I began researching diet information to help us.  All of my research led us to try Felidae grain free.  I spent two weeks carefully switching Louis (and the four girls) from dry Iams to Felidae.  I was immediately able to decrease his insulin and by the time I had him totally on Felidae we were able to discontinue insulin totally.  All with our veterinarian\'s supervision, a consistent feeding schedule and measured amounts. (It has not been effortless but it has been worthwhile.) Louis has been insulin free for two weeks now.  All five cats (ages 5 to 19) love the food.  Their stools are good, their coats look wonderful &amp; they haven\'t vomited for weeks. YAY! This cat food has great, healthy ingredients.  Cats shouldn\'t eat grain because it is not a part of their traditional diet.  (Think: Mice, Rodents, Moles, Grasses, Rabbits, Bird, etc)  I switched my cat from Iam\'s canned food to this one, thinking that I would have to mix them together at first to get her to eat it.  However, she ate it immediately! I was so happy!  As another reviewer said, there are whole peas in this stuff.  It looks a little gross, but my cat eats it. However, I must admit that she will eat just about anything.  Her favorite treats are sproated oat grass, spinach and broccoli stalks.  She\'s a good eater!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I switched to Felidae Grain free, my cat was vomiting frequently.  I think it was due to food allergies (either to grain or food coloring maybe)  Since switching she has only thrown up one time! You can only imagine how happy I am to not have to clean up vomit every other day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, since switching my cat\'s fur is much more smooth and soft! No more dry kibble for our felines!!!  After a few medical emergencies and educating myself WHY cats are not designed by Mother Nature to eat dry kibble (ANY brand), I changed our clan of felines to HEALTHY wet food.&lt;br /&gt;Every cat with a blocked urinary tract is fine, until they start to strain to urinate and have to be rushed to the ER.&lt;br /&gt;With all the issues of recalls and such concerning the pet food industry, we rotate 3 different brands of food. Felidae is one.  It has NO grains, soy, corn, or icky fillers. Felidae is a pate loaf-like consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Since changing to a wet food only diet, none of our cats have been back to ER in years.  None throw up.  No runny eyes.  Coats are shiny. No matted hair.  All are at a perfect weight.  The changes are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Having 5 cats, I am VERY thankful for the 13 oz size cans of Felidae.&lt;br /&gt;I had a question recently and sent Felidae an email.  They answered very promptly and were very kind.  Their customer service deserves 5 stars also. I\'d been feeding them Wellness until the recent recall. After checking some reviews, I looked around for something comparably healthy in the large size cans and decided to give this a shot. They\'re always enthusiastic at mealtimes, but they\'ve been literally climbing over each other at mealtimes for this. One caveat: Unlike the Wellness it has a pull tab, which is good news/ bad news. No need to mess with a can opener, but it\'s absolutely impossible to get it out without a spoon or a huge mess. This slop has the color and consistency of baby diarrhea with whole peas in it. Our cat ate less than half a bowl of this slop and immediately puked all over the carpet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She devours the Felidae Platinum, (which we feed as an occasional alternative to Newman\'s Own Turkey). She was raised on Felidae dry, so I can say that generally the Canidae Company provides quality products... except for this grain-free slop. You can find the good stuff at: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFL09S"&gt;Felidae Canned Cat Food for Senior and Overweight Cats, Platinum Diet Formula (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely do not order this slop from Amazon because they will charge you $10.70 for the privilege of returning the 11 cans your cat will not eat. Before you make the same stupid mistake I did, buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first. Then, when your cat pukes this slop back up, you will only be out $1.59 instead of the $27.94 Amazon nailed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, your cat and you will be much better off with Newman\'s Own Organic cat food, especially the turkey and chicken. The Newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death! After we listened to our former vet and fed her Science Diet K/D, she dropped down to less than 4 pounds in a month. We switched her back to Newman\'s Own Turkey and within one 24-case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of 6.2lbs, and has maintained that healthy weight for over 6 months. She also gained increased mobility after we stopped feeding her the K/D. I read somewhere that Science Diet buys veterinary students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just say NO to Science Diet and Felidae Grain Free Formula. Here\'s the good stuff: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK8HJ0"&gt;Newman\'s Own Organics Turkey &amp; Vegetable Formula for Cats, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Did they really want me to post a video with this review? Would you? Then its unanimous, this review will remain video-free!) Great price and my cat loves this food.  He has been on it for 9 years.  My vet says he is the healthest cat he sees. I\'ve been feeding Wellness grain-free for a while now and all three of them love it. I ordered the Felidae last time because the Wellness was no longer eligible for free shipping and the Felidae was - which makes the difference between whether it is a better deal to order it or buy it at Petco brick and mortar....None of my cats will eat it. They actually at NOTHING for the past 2 days since the only thing offered them was the Felidae. I broke down today and gave them a back-up can of 9-Lives grain free and they are happily curled up and purring now. I think Felidae is a high quality food and I only feed the lower quality grain-free food on rare occasion, but the rest of this case will be donated to my local shelter. Hopefully, something there will like it. I\'m off for the trip to Petco for the Wellness. My cats aren\'t usually picky and I\'ve had them on Natural Balance Venison grain free canned and dry food but one still has digestive problems (probably from ten years of eating "junk" kitty food) so I keep trying to find a food that will help to heal him. I tried Felidae and he and one other cat eats it, but the other two don\'t. I do believe one is extremely picky because he won\'t eat Halo brand either but loves the Natural Balance and Taste of the Wild grain free options. I hate having to buy so many different brands to please my four cats! Also - this says 95% protein derived from fish - so maybe they are having a distaste for the fish? It\'s too bad because they do love tuna but it causes the sick one to vomit every time. Oh well, it\'s a another miss in our family. My youngest cat goes insane over this stuff!  (Which is good -- she\'s the reason we had to seek out a new food that was for both adults and kittens.)  My older cat took a few weeks to adapt to the creamier texture, compared to her "favorite" canned food, although she loved the taste right away.  Once she got used to it, we started going through this case like it was going out of style and I had to buy more!  I have noticed much less smelly litter boxes since we got into this case, compared to many of the foods we use ... that was a big bonus for me, and enough to convince me to put this into our regular rotation of canned foods. I have the coolest different cats ever-with some exotic in them-and this stuff is amazing and really they seem to love it! It does not make the poo smell bad and the digestive system of some of mine-do not tolerate much grain or gluten so that is VERY much a PLUS!  The price on amazon is better for a large-can (amount / per ounce) than i can find at local pet shops or stores.  So when you can get the free shipping it is REALLY awesome to have pet foods at your door-service too! I hope Amazon will just continue to make pet food / supplies to your home affordable and at a top price!  Sometimes though when i go to try to re order cannot find (the same deals)available.  So I just lurk and watch and wait sometimes til it is Offered again to make it affordable. Not sure why -that happens but i know i have to (watch it) to make sure i don\'t end up with a high shipping fee in my cart-prior to purchase. Cats do occasionally need a little green in their diet.  Not a whole lot, but their typical "prey" in the wile would probably have vegetation in their stomachs when killed and eaten.  That being said, my kitties are weird and love to eat vegetables.  I have a toddler that likes to throw his food around so inevitably some ends up on the floor, and they are there to pounce when it falls!  The ingredients in this food are wholesome, my kitties eat this food whole peas and all, and it makes their coats wonderfully soft and silky.  This is not the only wet food I feed them, but it is one I do plan on keeping in their wet food rotation.  I give it my solid recommendation. We recently adopted a new kitten. We rotate Felidae grain-free canned formula with Wellness Turkey canned food. He loves both and eats well, he\'s never left a single whole pea behind. This is a very high-quality cat food, using excellent all-meat proteins. He is healthy, active,affectionate, and has a smooth glossy coat. Definitely worth the cost in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it is worthwhile to rotate different (high-quality) canned foods for variety and to not create a cat who will ONLY eat one brand. I think this is useful also in the event of a recall. I\'m looking for a 3rd high-quality brand to add to the rotation. I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten dry formula as he was a kitten at the time.&lt;br /&gt;I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats\' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey\'s stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what\'s found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it!&lt;br /&gt;I give him one small scoop of grain free kibble in the morning and then a partial can of this large 13oz Felidae grain free food (we\'ve tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will eat anything I give him :-)). I bought some can lids at Petsmart, and they seal air tight on these cans - so fridge storage is clean and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy - we haven\'t had a single vet visit since I adopted him (even though he had chronic upper respiratory issues when I got him, they all cleared up). I have to blame at least SOME of all this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or two of one) at the same time)! I used to buy this elsewhere, and since it\'s so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product! The consistency of the grain free chicken, turkey, lamb and fish formula was like&lt;br /&gt;baby poop.  There was so much water in this cat food that two cats went through a&lt;br /&gt;full case in a short time.  I can put the water in the cat food.  It is misleading&lt;br /&gt;and a poor value for the manufacturer to water down a product, call it a 13 oz can&lt;br /&gt;and provide nothing like I have come to know and expect from other brands the same&lt;br /&gt;size. I was really hoping this grain free canned cat food will work for my 3 cats; looks like it has good ingredients but none of my 3 cats will eat it. In fact one of them will smell it and start doing the scratching thing like he smells poop. Another weird thing is the whole can is kind of soft and meshed like baby food but there are some whole green peas in it, not sure if that is by design or some green peas escape the meshing. First off, my cats loved the food. One of them has had issues in the past and I need to be careful with what I feed him, and this seems to work well. However, about half the cans were your normal, semisolid cat-food consistency, and the other half were incredibly runny and nasty looking. They ate both kinds with equal gusto so I don\'t think anything was wrong with it, per se, but I still found it a little concerning. I\'m ordering another batch, and we\'ll see how that turns out. I gave it 3 stars because of the quality ingredients. But if neither of my cats will eat it, what\'s the use? We tried weaning them to this food from the junk we\'ve been feeding them by mixing and slowly increasing the amount of Felidae, or by getting them real hungry first, all to no avail. The only way they\'ll eat it is if we cover it with drippings from fish we cook for ourselves, or from cans of sardines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than anything, I think the mushy pate type texture bothers them more that the taste, because it smells pretty good to me. Wonderful ingredients list but the peas are whole. If I don\'t mush them several of my cats just eat around them.&lt;br /&gt;The cats &amp; I all prefer the regular Felidae formula and it\'s a little cheaper, too. This Yuban DARK ROAST is outstanding.  It is smooth with a chocolaty taste.  I find it as good as any far more expensive coffees.  I would also recommend purchasing the 11-ounce cannisters because the coffee is freshest when you can pop open a new can and use it up without refrigerating or freezing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like many dark roasted coffees because I don\'t like the burnt taste.  Yuban DARK ROAST has NO burnt or bitter taste.  Definitely shun the regular roast for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, keep in mind that this review is written by someone who thinks Starbucks is far, far overrated (bitter, burnt). If you like strong coffee, this is it!  The flavor is exceptional, I have not found better in a can.  This can be expensive and difficult to find at your local store.  I have had great luck with Amazon, good price for the subscription order (you can get a case a couple times a year and still get the reduced rate).  Amazon also has a wonderful return policy!&lt;br /&gt;Try Yuban if you love strong coffee and have not found the coffee for you, this may be it!  We have been drinking it for 10+ years now &amp; have had the Original, Organic and Dark Roast---I dont have a preference, they are all excellent. My husband and I are always searching for better coffee...and seemingly there seems to be something wrong with them all! LOL I have finally decided that Yuban is without fail MY favorite coffee...it has no aftertaste, is not bitter in any way and it remains constant can after can. On that note, my husband can go grabbing different can after and grinding himself silly if he wishes;  complaining about each one...I\'m settled on Yuban forevaaaaaaa. : ) Excellent.  We have enjoyed Yuban coffee for many years.  We recently tried the Dark Roast Coffee and would recommend it if you want a rich tasting coffee.  Smooth; with no bitterness.  Beats the high price of many "Gourmet Coffees" without sacrificing that delicious flavor that coffee lovers look for. Yuban makes the best cup of coffee. Either roast is never bitter, and makes a great cup of coffee. We like our coffee extra-strong, and we have been using Yuban for years. The coffee is very consistent and distinctive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best canned ground coffee out there, period. We have found none to match the true dark, smooth cup of coffee. There is no bitterness or burnt taste, just silky, rich coffee. Add a dab of half-n-half, and you have bliss in a cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\'t spend your money on the expensive "designer" coffees. This is the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are persnickety about coffee, buy Yuban! Living in Baton Rouge my wife and I drank the popular regional coffee - Community Coffee, we now guess out of loyalty. When we became full time RV\'ers in February 2007, we packed 5 lbs of that coffee but ran out in Missouri, so we tried other dark roast, including Maxwell House Gourmet Dark Roast and then the Yuban Dark Roast. OMG - what a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We\'ll never buy anything except Yuban Dark Road - smooth and silky without that burnt or bitter taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to find in South Louisiana, but easier nationwide. Then there\'s always Amazon with delivery within 5-days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ya gotta try it! Yikes!  What was I thinking when I ordered 12 cans of this  stuff?  The food pantry may be getting some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes like.....well, I can\'t use the words I\'d like to.&lt;br /&gt;Let\'s just say that it has no character at all...no distinct taste....if yu blinded yourself and then drank the coffee, I don\'t know if you\'d even know it was coffee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use just more than the amount suggessted;..;...doesn\'t help. I can only say that this is great coffee, never tried before until recently.. Now I like it better than Folgers! I was drinking Yuban Organic medium roast coffee until I could not find it anymore at my local grocery store so I tried this instead.  What a let down after drinking the organic coffee.  This just tastes like average grocery store coffee comparable to Folgers but the organic stuff, now that\'s a different story. That stuff is good. Tastes damn near as good as the fresh stuff you can buy at Dunn Bros or Caribou coffee houses.  Don\'t believe me try both this and the organic version side by side.  You won\'t go back to this again I promise you that if you have any coffee sense at all. Until recently I thought that coffee was coffee but apparently it\'s not that simple. Drinking coffee can either be an good habit for the environment or a very bad one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is, Going Green is easy! Look for the certification by environmental watch-dogs like the Rainforest Alliance and keep up the demand for Arabica (uh-RA-bih-kuh) or Rainforest Blend coffee; just ask for them at your local grocery store or favorite coffee house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GoGreenMart&amp;More voted Yuban as a Product of the Week because the great taste helps wake you in the morning and protects the environment as well. I Wish They Hadn\'t Changed the Formula for the Yuban that was sold up until about 2 years ago. I even contacted General Foods and asked why they had reformulated their coffee and they told me they were going back to their "original" formula from many years ago. Why? They had a great product and now it is no better that any other dark roast coffee on the market. Yuban was a special treat. Now it is just ordinary. I still like it for everyday coffee, but it sure isn\'t what it used to be. Formerly, I even preferred it to Starbucks, but no more. We had not been able to find the Dark Roast Yuban in any of the stores recently. When I ordered this they gave me a date of receipt. It actually came two days earlier. My husband was so excited when he saw what I had ordered. Thanks for the quick service on a great product. Warning: it contains food preservatives. Other than that it is fine, but presence of preservatives in dates (!) justifies my low 2 star rating. I own a small night club and this is, hand\'s down, the most popular snack item we have. At first we were just giving it away until we started going through way too much of it to justify that anymore. In addition it is not available anywhere in town and, before we found it here, we had to go to a Sam\'s club 50+ miles away to stock up on it. apparently it is about as close to being the perfect blend for a wide variety of tastes as one could expect to find. The company also makes a "Club" mix, as opposed to the "Pub" mix. I made the mistake of buying a huge supply of that and met will strong and continued ire from our clientele. They look about the same but apparently the Club mix lacks some vital ingredient. I received a whole package of this delicious, tasty, perfectly seasoned mix that contains just the correct variety of snacks (pretzels, crackers, nuts, etc) .  Of course, here in Iraq we look forward to receiving care packages and the awesome snacks they contain.  However, this snack was the "Cat\'s Meow".  It is honestly the best snack mix I have ever tasted and my fellow Marines agree on this also.  Once it was eaten by all, everyone was inquiring where I had received it and I could only say a caring patriot who included it in one of their care box of goodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I loved it so much that I ended up on this page because I decided to go online and search for it, and see if I can get multiple packages of this shipped to my unit here in Iraq.  I don\'t mind paying a few extra bucks for it, to have for me and my fellow Marines to enjoy.  It\'s just that good that it\'s worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is a great product and all should try it.  After you do, you won\'t think that Chex Mix can light even a dim candle next to the UTZ PUB MIX.  Believe me, try it, and you\'ll want to keep this stocked in your cabinet for everyone in your family and their friends to enjoy. I found these tubs at Costco and was dismayed to discover that they are no longer carrying them. I buy the 4-pack here at amazon and I am very satisfied. The snacks are tasty; not too salty and offers a variety of chips in the mix that all blend nicely. This is definitely the best snack mix I have ever had!  It got me and my buddies through many movie nights while deployed in Iraq. I agree with all who have said that this is a great snack, but I just wanted to say that I piad $36.95 for a 4 pack of 30 oz containers from the actual UTZ site. This pub mix is really a cut above your average snack to be sure.  I tend to pick up a tub of it at the local Walmart here anytime I venture there.  The flavor of it is really hard to pin down.  It\'s sorta a salty, garlic/onion/whatever type of blend that truly works deliciously.  I\'m a self confessed snack-a-holic that has tried just about everything around, and personally I have not tasted anything that is quite like this blend.  It\'s really good with your favorite beer, or just by itself and I highly recommend it.  The only down side to this stuff is the price.  Which is not something usually cared about or taken into account with UTZ products, which tend to be very reasonably priced for the most part.  Unfortunately like a lot of things that are really good, this mix is not easily found locally.  I see it only at the local Walmart here in the small 20 oz size that carries a hefty price.  I buy it anyway on occasion for its so good, but make no mistake about it, its not cheap as snack chips go.  And unfortunately I do not recommend buying this mix on Amazon in any size.  It\'s way too expensive here for any deal currently being offered.  If you wanna try it or like it already, I suggest you search it out locally at your big department stores, (it\'s never found in supermarkets \'round these parts), spring for the price, and grab an ice cold beer and enjoy... I tasted this snack at my local pub and found it tasty... much better than chips or other mixes. I was told it was sold in Sam\'s club and Wegman\'s for $18 per 30 0z container. Bought it from Utz in a 4 pack for $41.00.&lt;br /&gt;Each piece has a different taste and texture...Could not ask for a more delicious snack or a better price. Thank you Utz! Hands down, the best snack you will ever voraciously consume at a potentially unhealthy pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does contain MSG, so do be warned, but if that does not dissuade you (as it would never me), give this a shot. This has been a godsend during road trips, movie knights, parties, and general get-togethers of all kinds. Enjoyed the product and they also provided very fast shipping.  I\'m about out and need to order more. This mix is great anytime.  I love it.  Would recommend it to anyone that likes Chex mix. I absolutely love this mix.  We keep it on our home bar and everyone loves it. I found this mix at the Ft Myer Commissary.  I looked for this product last time I visited the commissary and could not find it.  So here I am online looking and found it here.  I could eat this all day.  I\'ve tried several different snack mixes, but most have too many pretzels.  This has a very nice balance of flavors and textures -- and not a lot of pretzels.  I\'m stocking up!! This is an addicting, fantastic snack mix. It has a wonderful variety of crackers and blend of flavors. The taste is great but it gave me a terrible migraine from the MSG.  Those who are sensitive beware.  Also, MSG addition is usually a way to fake true flavor. ; the problem with this mix -- and to mind, the only problem! -- is the inclusion of one or two slightly sugary little... things. This provides an experience of, well, repugnance, at least for me; I\'ve never been one to mix the sodium and the glucose, and this surely ain\'t converting me. ESPECIALLY when they\'re in the same bite/handful. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this mix is really yummy. It all tastes rather waxy, and I\'m sure is not the healthiest food in the world (though you could do worse), but its a well combined mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then again, I\'ve got to sort of work my way through at a crawling pace, because I must grab a handful, and then separate the rejects. Maybe I\'m just neurotic, or maybe they made A FATAL MISTAKE AND SHOULD BE PUNISHED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, like the last reviewer, I too got \'em at Costco. Cat grass seeds will sprout very easily---you can sprinkle them on top of any kind of moisture retaining soil or peat moss.  My cats eat the sprouts very quickly.  I suggest that you purchase multiple seed packs.  I did so to insure that I would have more sprouts ready when the first wave was gobbled.  The only drawback is shipping cost--which is more than the seed packets themselves.  That\'s another reason to order in multiples.  The shipping cost for several packages is the same as for a single packet. This is good stuff.  However, I planted it, and no cats grew up.  Just grass. Cat Grass is not only a treat that cats love to eat, it is also good for them and will help deter them away from eating houseplants!  My cat often nibbles on houseplants then throws up and I\'m always afraid that it will do damage to her digestive system.  When there is cat grass around, though, she only eats that - she really chows it down, and it makes her happy, too!  Cat grass is also good for cats - it contains vitamins that may or may not be present in cat food, and it aids their digestive system and helps to eliminate fur balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you do not have a green thumb, cat grass is so easy to grow, that anyone can do it and it\'s also a great "project" for kids, too.  The seeds sprout very quickly (if you keep them moist) and will grow quickly to 4-6inches in a window sill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have cats, cat grass is a must! The packet of these seeds that I received must have been old because I don\'t believe even 10% of them grew. I tried some several times in soil and water and only got a few sprigs of grass. I garden regularly (I live in Florida) so it\'s not that I don\'t know how, and I even followed the instructions to the letter, but they did not grow. I\'ve had luck with this seed and all the other packets I\'ve purchased from Botanical Interests (the company that makes it).&lt;br /&gt;Right now, the packet\'s over a year old and I recently planted another pot and had a high germination rate in about two days and it was about three inches tall in four days.&lt;br /&gt;The cats love it. They ate so much I planted yet another pot.&lt;br /&gt;Having the grass around deters our cats from gnawing on strange things, like plastic, especially when they are having digestive problems. Great product.  The indoor kitties love to have grass to nibble on.  This grass grows and is ready to nibbling in 10 days or less.&lt;br /&gt;My How-To:&lt;br /&gt;Get a small, shallow plastic container with a lid.&lt;br /&gt;Punch several holes in the bottom of the container with a nail.&lt;br /&gt;Fill the container with organic soil, sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of seeds on top, pack the seeds into the soil by pressing them in firmly. W&lt;br /&gt;ater until some of kit leaks out the holes in the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;Place on a dish; put on the lid; keep out of the way for the seeds to germinate-- checking to water every 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;Once the grass has grown about 2 inches, remove the lid and place in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Put grass in a new heavier bowl so the cats can\'t pull the entire patty of grass out or walk off with the container with they nibble it. YUM, I am SO HAPPY my mom bought this delicious and nutritious cat grass for me!  It helps me digest my food, and is just fun to poke around in when I\'m bored.  And I notice that mom eats it too (when she thinks I\'m not looking!) because it is so tasty! I use this to grow my cat grass every month or so.  Now that it\'s spring I can find the terra cotta pots at the stores again.  I just keep two and alternate so he always has grass growing.  He loves it, so I bought several packs at once, probably more than I\'ll need!  I get several batches out of each packet. None have been "duds" so far either. Cat grass, also known as wheat grass, is a great plant for anyone. I typically don\'t do any type of gardening, but I had no trouble getting these seeds to sprout and grow. These seeds make a great project for gardeners, cat lovers, and children, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hardest part of caring for these plants is keeping your cats from keeping from devouring them completely! That\'s what happened to mine, at least, and my cats still -- several months later -- will check the area where I kept the cat grass for more of this tasty plant. Received this product much sooner than promised. Seeds grow as claimed and plant is great. My cat loves it. Highly recommend product and seller. This stuff is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grows very fast and grows into a full grass section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cat loves it and with other cat grasses I have purchased, she has vomited after sometimes, but this stuff she hasnt (so far)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like another reviewer said... shipping for one package is same price if you buy 10, so stock up and save on shipping, and the package was very nice, wasnt just thrown in an envelope! We have been buying Cat Grass for many years and this product is very well priced and works just as good as the expensive packages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Cats have "Grown" healthy and happy since they have this grass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Seller - delivered on time and product sold is exactly what we wanted and will purchase again. Cat grass is cat grass, and I have one cat that absolutely loves it; another that couldn\'t care less.  It\'s winter now, so I couldn\'t find it where I buy seeds, so I went on line.  Product is okay, service was prompt.  My disappointment: could only order one two-ounce package per shipping and handling fee.  Cat grass only lasts a couple of weeks, and I would have ordered 3 or 4 packages, but not at 3 or 4 times that shipping fee! So, these seeds do exactly as advertised.  I bought 10 paks of seeds, and have so far used 4.  I always get a pot full of strong, bright green grass, which my cat readily devours.  Not much else can be said.  Good deal, good grass. Man. I have been growing this "Cat Grass" for my 3 little dog, however I don\'t have the nerve to tell them this is for cats.  I noticed our dogs would occasionally chew grass at the park or leaves from trees, considering the chemicals that may be used on other plants I decided to grow my own.&lt;br /&gt;My little guys love this stuff, but there is one problem being dogs they can be a little messy and they tend to want to rip the grass right out of the pot roots &amp; all.  I have taken to trimming the grass daily and placing it next to their water bowl.&lt;br /&gt;Trimming just seems to stimulate the grass to grow faster, much like your lawn.  As with your lawn I find that adding nutrients (Iron) to the grass it keeps it\'s beautiful color and many months of fresh new grass.&lt;br /&gt; Don\'t know the exact reason my dogs like grass, it might be just like humans we like a salad for a change maybe it just add something that is missing from their diets.  Guess you might say "Dogs can\'t live on meat alone" or something like that. I planted this grass and in 8 days I had 3-4 inches of grass!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price hurts since you\'re basically paying for shipping. The cost of the seeds themselves are $1.59 as shown on the package. I couldn\'t find oat grass seeds at Lowes or my local independent garden center. I\'m hoping to find somewhere local to buy them so I can buy more seeds in the future without having to pay a premium and wait for them to ship. The grass sprouted quickly, with a great germination rate. The cats LOVE it, so much that they tried to get to it by knocking it off the mantle while I was out of town. The pot was upside down for at least a day, and it looked like the grass was all going to die. However, a week later it has almost fully recovered, so it\'s pretty hearty. Our cats love the grass.  It\'s easy to grow and it sprouts within a few days so you have an ample supply on hand continually.  An excellent product to maintain a cat\'s health. I wanted to grow some cat grass for my kitty to distract him from my other plants in the house. I planted them in a large window sill box with potting soil. I had a large bunch of grass in about a week. My cat loves it and it looks great in my kitchen. I normally purchase already-grown containers of cat grass at my local pet store. However, the last few pots developed bugs in them, which just wasn\'t sanitary. I bought these seeds from Hirts and they grew insanely fast! My cats love the taste. I\'ve already bought another pack so I can re-plant once the cats finish off this batch. These seeds grow very easy, one seed pack grew about 7 little pots. I would grow using a few seeds about every 4-5 days in 2 separate little pots for my cats so they never was without. A great buy. Excellent germination!  Only 4 days and about 90% of the seeds are up to an inch.  If I hadn\'t done this before, the instructions would have been wonderful, they left nothing out. I WILL buy these again. This was the only seed pack I bought of three different brands that came up and the cats are still enjoying. Tiger loves the cat grass..It only takes about a week after the grass is planted to come up..So it grows very fast..I planted it in a pot outside it did very good outside.. It was so easy to grow and my cat loved it. I highly recommend this purchase. Your cat will love you forever! Unfortunately, bunnies love it, too, so we are having to grow this batch of cat grass indoors.  The cats love this stuff:  just put it where they can reach it and they will "go to town" on it, munching it all up.  It does not make them behave erratically, like catnip does, so don\'t worry about that.  You don\'t have to do anything to these seeds other than press them into some moist soil and water when the soil starts to become dry and crumbly.  That\'s it!  A nutritious treat for your cats! These seeds always grow, unlike some other brands. Every single one of my cats totally loves the resulting oat grass. There is nothing else that all five of them all agree on so unanimously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for such a great batch of seeds! In less than a week, my kitties had grass to much on.  I was surprised with their reaction to it, it seemed like she was given this before at her previous home.  She rushed right to it as soon as she saw it and gnawed it down to nothing.  The first time it got eaten, the plants sprang back to life and grew faster than before, but after being annihilated a second time, the grass kind of dried up and died.  Which is okay, because I have plenty more seeds in the pack. Excellent product and price. Would do business with this company again.&lt;br /&gt;My cat loves it. Can\'t wait to plant it again. the true test is that our cats really loves the grass we grow from these seeds! and they grew very easily in pots, too. I bought 4 packets and planted one of them.  It only took a couple of days for the sprouts.  My cats love it! My two cats must not be interested in grass, because it grew but they ignored it. Had no problems growing it. It was hard to grow but once it grew my cat loved it. I haven\'t found any seeds that work well yet, but I am still looking. I would buy this again is=f I had better luck with growing it. This product is great for growing cat grass.  Gives a hearty grass is easy &amp; fast growing.  Will purchase in the future. It got here fast, grew quickly and my cats love it. Excellent choice anyone can make their cats very happy by purchasing this product, plus my cats have completely stopped chewing on all other plants in the house. Our cat loves to eat this grass and it was so easy to grow too. I have never been much into growing plants but this was easy and actually useful rather than just grow plants around the house. Recommended product. I have 3 cats...2 could care less..the other one LOVES this so much.  I have it by their food bowls and she nibbles on it every day.  No throwing up like outside grass. My cat love this grass. Really easy to grow, only 3 days. Im not going to count the seeds but i dont think they are 500 seeds. i have 3 cats here at home and they need to dosome grazing so i baught  this to see if they like it :) even though its just out grass lol Don\'t know why people want to step in cold cat vomit on their to the bathroom in the middle of night, but this will get the job done. Vomit stains carpets, beds, shirts. You will find hard, old fossilized vomit under beds occasionally too.  Entire rooms of carpet will need replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have all wood floors and love cat vomit, go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is a beautiful decorative grass when potted on it\'s own or mixed with herbs. Just keep out of cat\'s reach. Good air freshener if you grow enough indoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No idea why people want cat vomit indoors though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars because it is wheat grass which can be bought in bulk much cheaper for couple bucks more. I just picked these up at random at my local Asian market, and I am really impressed. I\'d drive the 15-20 minutes there again just to pick these up. They have an excellent coffee flavor and aren\'t horribly sweet like most hard candies. Each candy is individually wrapped and lasts a good long time. Great candy! Sweet and intense, low calorie and delightful. Made with actual coffee, not just flavoring. Fantastic. Reasonably priced too. Japanese sweet but strong black coffee candy. Lasts a long time in your mouth and costs alot less on Amazon than elsewhere. Made with real caffeinated coffee for a little energy. There is nothing wrong with this product, but it is overpriced.  With a little research you can buy this for less than half the price.  Buyer beware My cats really love this 9 Lives Seafood and Poultry cat food.&lt;br /&gt;They prefer this pate to the slices or chunks.&lt;br /&gt;They are a perfect weight and have beautiful shiny coats&lt;br /&gt;and lots of energy.&lt;br /&gt;It is good quality food and is very fresh. We enjoy these peanut butter and jelly bars.  My 5 year old with celiac disease says he can have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich again.  He loves to pack these for school snack. My 2 year old recently was diagnosed allergic to Gluten. These Pb &amp; J bars have saved us. He loves them and these are his favorite flavor. I tried these bars and they were very good, although I do like the Peanut butter chocolate chip bars better. The bars are a quick and easy to carry snack when you are on the go! Out of all the granola bars that Bakery on Main makes my 2 year old loves these the most. Maybe it\'s because she can still get the taste of a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich but in a snack bar :) We always have to have a box of this flavor in the house. These are good bars for being gluten free.  Not my favorite bar out of everything they carry but still good to keep around for a hunger attack.  If you really want to try something great try their Coconut Cashew Trubar.  Now, that\'s incredible! It\'s like you are being naughty but you\'re not! You just can\'t go wrong with peanut butter and jelly. These were so delicious. As with the apple cinnamon, I had a hard time keeping my gluten free fearing husband away from these! Yummy!!! One of the best peanut butter bars I\'ve ever had. The fruit jelly is so good and brings the whole thing together in a good snack or dessert. Of all the flavors I have tried of these bars, the Peanut butter and Jelly is my favorite!  Everyone loves peanut butter and jelly and it is just as delicious as a bar! This is my favorite granola bar! Being vegan and gluten-free is difficult when it comes to finding granola bars that meet my  needs. This one is absolutely delicious! I love the ingredients and all the strawberries throughout the whole bar.  Highly recommend!!! My sweet daughter loves these.  I mean what kid doesn\'t love PB&amp;J, and what mom loves not having to make it!  They are sweet, and make you feel like you are not missing out on anything being gluten free.  Highly recommend it! Wonderful! My son loves these granola bars! He has celiac and we wanted to try something different, these were a hit! My girls love these bars!  They are nice for lunches or quick snacks on the go!  Good flavor!  Gluten free and Dairy free is difficult, but Bakery on Main does it right!  YUMMY Peanut butter and jelly together. How can you go wrong? It is great and without the worries of gluten makes it even better. I love these.  They really taste like a soft PB&amp;J sandwich, and you can bring them anywhere!  Kids would love them too.  I hope they\'re available again soon because I\'m running low! Childhood nostagia all over again! I LOVE peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but I don\'t often make them because they\'re rather messy. These bars solve that problem-- the oats and stuff provide a perfect compliment to the peanut butter and jelly flavor that\'s in the bar. The best part is that I can eat this on the go and not have to worry about my hands or clothes getting messed up. It is cubes for our horses. They came in on time and the horses like them. There is not much more to say about sugar cubes. All my horses love a sweet reward. Dots hold together nicely in the reward bag. The fact that the title of this product includes the number 3000 is misleading.  I\'m not even sure what that number refers to.  I can tell you that it does not refer to the quantity of gumballs in the package (which is 850).  It\'s true that the product details stated the actual quantity of 850, but apparently I glossed over that fact.  The price is still a good deal compared to other vendors on Amazon; just not quite as good as I had originally thought.  Shipping took a week longer than expected, but I did receive and apology email.  The gumballs themselves were well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy from this vendor again (assuming that the consumption of 850 gumballs does not kill me). I LOVE this tea. It is, hands down, my favorite.  And the ingredients are very "clean" and it\'s low calorie--especially compared to other teas out there.  This is the real deal.  It\'s basically like making it at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\'s SO yummy!  Light, refreshing.  I could drink it all day, by the gallon.  :) My husband and I love this product because it is naturally sweet without the taste of artificial sweeteners.  Most peach flavored teas taste like sugar and artificial flavors but not this drink.  It is wonderfully watery to quench any thirst.  I only wish that Amazon would always sell it because we would buy it on a regular basis. Look at the ingredients...it is made with Black Tea...Google Black tea and Fluoride and you will see that black tea is LOADED with fluoride because it is made with the oldest part of the tea plant it contains the highest level of fluoride of any tea. Fluoride is not healthy for anyone. If you want a healthy natural tea, get one that is made with white tea leaves. White tea leaves still have all the beneficial antioxidant properties but much, much , much less fluoride than either black or green teas. Just received a case of this tea.  It tastes good and a bit on the sweet side, but not overly sweet.  I would give it a higher and better rating if it is not made in China though. Since Republic of Tea discontinued their Bing Cherry Vanilla tea, I was looking for a replacement.  The flavor of this tea is very different from Republics - it\'s better.  The smell is very rich, like toasted vanilla and cherry.  It almost has a coffee smell, but not quite.  I don\'t like coffee, but this tea is incredible.  Glad I found it.  Best of all, the price! I really like this tea, but my husband smelled it and commented that it smells like Robitussin cough syrup.  The taste is more subtle than the aroma.  Overall, this tea tastes good and is a good value.  It\'s not the best tasting cherry vanilla or cherry tea I have ever tasted, but I would purchase it again. If you can get over the high price, why not enjoy some of the best coffee in the world, right here in the good ol\' USA?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: once you get spoiled by this coffee, you might not ever settle for less!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: great product, would recommend to a friend. I have a bag of this coffee shipped to me every other month. I do notice the flavor can vary over time. With that said, the worse I\'ve had was just plain great, and the best roasts are to die for. I\'ve noticed this variation with other coffees too. I always assumed it was the minute differences in roasting, and of course the bean itself. Being a plant, it will hardly have the exact same characteristics of another plant. Perhaps weather variations count too. This last year, the flavor and taste has been more consistent than it was a few years back. Everyone has different tastes but speaking for myself, this is as close to perfect as it gets. I enjoyed my 1st cup very much.  The aroma was heady and the flavor was pleasantly mild.  But, ultimately, it is too mild for my daily morning "kick". I\'ll be going back to my Lavazza mornings when this is gone. Tried this because it is 100% Kona and much cheaper than the other national brands I have been using. What can i say i am greatly surprised. Mild, no bite too it and no discernable acidity. This is on my shopping list from now on. Spent $29  for real kona coffee and didn\'t want the kona blend sold here. The Hawaiian roasters was disappointing. Tasted nothing like the kona we had everyday while honeymooning in Maui. Not good This is by far the best Kona Coffee I\'ve had. I use to purchase Trader Joes Kona Coffee but for the last several months they haven\'t had any and I\'ve been unable to locate Kona any where so I thought I\'d try Amazon. I saw this and although the price is staggering, the coffee is amazing. Very smooth with great taste. I drink it both hot and cold. A pound makes a lot of coffee and while I didn\'t figure the price per cup, I still think it\'s worth it and will purchase it again. I have tried a few kona coffees from different vendors, and I can say that this one is a very special coffee. I made an order last year and had some issues with one of the two bags I\'ve bought. The coffee lost it\'s freshness in the 2nd bag and it was very old, dry and tasteless. I was very disappointed by how the same coffee could taste so different in each bag. I wasn\'t sure what was the problem, cause the 1st bag tasted very pleasant and aromatic. The freshness, texture and delicacy of the coffee took me to nirvana. I was very pleased with the organic taste and smoothness of the coffee. Immediately I knew that this was a very special gourmet coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\'ve tried different regional coffees including, papa new guinea, Kenya AA, Sumatra beans, Jamaican blue mountain ... and others. I have to say that Kona is my favorite by far. The shipping bag comes oxygen free when it\'s being shipped from the vendor. The air is sucked dry to vacuum seal it. Sometimes they get damaged or punctured during shipping. I guess that\'s what happened to one of the bags. As you know, coffee and oxygen don\'t go well together, cause once the coffee is oxidized; it starts losing its freshness and it doesn\'t taste the way it\'s supposed to taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\'ve made a recent purchase again and I\'m very happy with the results. Give this coffee a try before deciding to make a bulk shipment. You have got nothing to lose. Well done Hawaii Roasters. You guys have outdone yourselves. My son was on vacation a couple of years ago and brought back Hawaii Roaster Kona Coffee. They have a different technique the way it is grown then most coffees. I thought I would check to see if it was on Amazon. This is the best tasting coffee I ever tasted.  Well worth the money. This coffee has a smoother and milder taste than a dark roasted coffee.  I like to have this coffee and a dark roasted on alternate mornings.  The daily contrast in taste keeps me appreciating the delicious coffee favors of each type. This coffee, whether brewed in the Keurig via eco cup or in a standard coffee pot tasted stale.  Not the award-winning coffee that I expected to taste.  It didn\'t take me back to Hawaii, but instead took me to the Folger\'s coffee aisle in the grocery store.  Will not order again.  What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;updated 2/3/12 - The seller got in touch with me and offered to refund my money.  He apologized for the coffee not being up to standard.  The seller has good communication.  Maybe I just got a bad batch.  Who knows...  Thank you! This coffee was delicious! I actually purchased it as a gift, but since I paid $30 for 1 lb of coffee, I tasted the freakin coffee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was so good! I meant to purchase the light roast, but accidentally ordered the medium. It was full bodied and delicious, totally lacking the high acidity that you find with most commercial coffees. I can\'t afford 100% pure Kona all the time and normally buy blends, but this coffee is the delicious gourmet coffee you need to buy and keep for company or to treat yourself now and then. The best thing I like about this sports drink, is it\'s not an energy drink. Low calories (15) and less caffeine then 8 ounces of coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plethora of natural anti-inflammatory ingredients, which mitigates aches and pains. And it\'s not necessary to take over the counter Acetaminophen when you have this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first had some, I felt different. Not a amp different, rushed. Just different; scared me a bit. 3 days later I tried it again. The feel different was the pain level going from the constant 8-9 to a 6 (which is manageable for me). The feel difference, was me feeling better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is giving me the 4-5 year window I need before I have to get my neck and spine fused (again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At our house now, we have at least 3 cases and this month, it is 4. This jerky is quite pricey for a 6.5 ounce bag, but it\'s one of the few I\'ve found that is salty enough and doesn\'t contain a bunch of sweeteners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smoke flavor is also pronounced.  Unfortunately, the price is the only thing that keeps this product from getting 5 stars from me. I\'ve reviewed this before - this jerky is fabulous. Great salt, great snap, great flavor. So tasty. I want some now. These were a wonderful surprise, more delicious than anticipated and guilt-free. I liked the smaller size pouches. Easy to carry with me; nice to give as a gift. The bonus is that they are organic. I will be buying more. I picked up a package during an airport layover and since I won\'t be back to LAX soon... decided to check Amazon for some more.  The 4 oz package cost 7.99 at the airport, so you do get a small price break by buying them here in triple packs.&lt;br /&gt;WOW!  The flavor is amazing.  I don\'t know if the other reviewer got a bad batch -- or what -- but mine were crunchy walnuts with the smoothest slightly sweet tasting thick dark chocolate coating.  One bite and I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a sweet treat for your sweetie, look no further.  this should be in every adult Easter basket or Christmas stocking.  I haven\'t raved about a candy like this since See\'s dark chocolate covered raspberry cremes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like walnuts and dark chocolate, you will absolutely love these.  The taste is so pleasurable it is hard to describe.  I just ordered 6 packages, for me and to use as gifts.  Amazon, you need to start selling these so I can use prime shipping!  (these will fly off the shelf, I promise!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ingredients:  Organic Walnuts, organic ark chocolate coating -- ooh there is some organic chocolate liquour and soy lethicin in there, that\'s why it\'s so tasty and smooth.  Contains small amounts of milk, soy wheat and egg and is manufactured in a plant that processes peanuts.  Made in the USA by Tropical Valley Foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES, these will melt in your hand or the hot sun, so be forewarned! I like my chocolate tempered to some level of crispness. These nuts were chewy, not crunchy, and the chocolate coating was a bit mealy.&lt;br /&gt;If you know anything about dark chocolate, and like yours with some snap, don\'t order these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, the best dark chocolate covered walnuts are called Perigord and are available through a Canadian company called Kis Global.&lt;br /&gt;They are sun dried, super crispy, covered in a fairly thin shell of 70% dark chocolate, and dusted with unsweetened cocoa.&lt;br /&gt;Very adult and superb. The walnuts and chocolate are very high quality. They are rich and decadent. It seems strange but when I\'m eating just a small piece it tastes like I\'m eating a brownie. Highly recommended. The product is great...but it arrived mostly melted together instead of individual drop pieces.  I am sure it was over heated in the shipping.  We live in central California where temperatures get into the 100s.  I am  able to use them, anyway, by just cutting them up.&lt;br /&gt;Partly my fault...I will try to remember to order during the winter months for cooler weather.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product... These smell so good I\'m tempted to try them myself!  I have to keep real chocolate locked up in my house because my two chocoholic dogs will raid cupboards and chew open drawers to get to it, but they are very happy with these instead.  I\'m so glad I found this safe alternative for them. My dogs (and some other dogs I like to spoil too) just love these.  They are their special treats. I must say that Vitakraft has put life back into my dog. He is old and Vitakraft offers him more vitamins and minerals than what he was getting from his food. Now he has more energy and begs for these choco drops. I found these at a local pet store and couldn\'t locate them again.  Great price and dogs love them.  I rec\'d my shipment quickly with no problems. I bought this product because my dogs were having accidents in the laundry room overnight.  I\'m not sure how or why this works...but it stopped them from peeing.  The dogs love em too. Have been buying this product for over a year and \'MAX\' would eat  it as fast as I could give it to him. However one or two drops at a time for a reward, is his limit ! yogurt is his favorite. My dog loves Vitakraft Dog Drops with Carob so much, he\'ll do any trick possible to have one!  Sadly, they\'re getting harder and harder to find, so I was thrilled to find them here - and the price was great! A superior dog treat with a chocolate flavor. These drops are not toxic to dogs and are vitamin enriched. My dogs just love them.  My grandchildren ate few thinking they were "Hershey kisses"!! The children\'s mother who is a Pharmacist stated that the drops were not toxic to children or dogs!! The  product is excellent,service from the Amazon supplier was excellent but I wish they (any supplier) would not use UPS as a shipper. UPS is slower than "Snail Mail"!! My puppy, Megabyte, is a very picky puppy.  After spending hundreds of dollars on finding treats that she will eat.  These are one of only two. We ordered the product...our dog loves them...but no one cares if its 100 degrees outside.  recieved in one big melted ball.  thought they would ship in dry ice.  If its summer or hot in your area dont order them !! My Pug absolutely adores these treats and will do anything for one.  I can get anything away from her and get her to go anywhere.  They are a big help for me and a wonderful treat for her. My dog loves these treats. I can get him to do anything using them. They were much cheaper using Amazon even with the shipping charges. BY THE TIME I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT ALL 3 PACKAGES WERE MELTED SO ALL HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN EACH BAG HAD MELTED TOGETHER I can not believe that this is actually for sale. It needs to be recalled. Sugar is absolutely unhealthy for all your pets. They do not digest/assimilate sugar like we do. Every Vet will tell you  the same thing and you will never see any quality treats or food that has sugar or corn syrup on the ingredient list. If you do see it on the list, DO NOT BUY IT!! This is my 2nd review for this product.  The first one was supposed to be 75 words.  That would be too long for this item.  The product itself is good but the price for shipping for such a small item was ridiculous.  The package was small and light weight but I was charged $6.78 for shipping of a $4.99 item.  I have bought many items from amazon.com and it seems here lately that the shipping has gotten totally out of hand. I bought several items and the shipping was all together.  Therefore I did not know how much was charged for each item. I will not buy from this vendor again since they are making money on the shipping.  Enough said. Key lime pie is one of my all-time favorite desserts. When I heard about this gum I was definitely a skeptic, I figured it\'d taste more like just a standard, citrus-y/mint gum. I was wrong! This definitely tastes like real key-lime pie filling: actual key-lime flavor with a milk-sweet taste that\'s not too overpowering. The flavor actually lasts for quite a while too (though it\'s much more powerful within the first 5 minutes). Try it! But I\'ll give it a shot.  Wow.  So far I have only tried (and intend to try) the Key Lime Pie and the Mint Chocolate Chip but they are both amazing.  They key lime pie is incredibly tart and delicious but unfortunately the flavor only lasts about 10 seconds.  The Mint Chocolate Chip is also incredible and the flavor seems to last much longer (or at least, the dulled post-flavor gum is more appealing).  In any event, even for 5 seconds of flavor these gums are a gem.  Great idea by Wrigley. Key Lime Pie is getting rave reviews throughout my office!  I bought a pack of it to share with my co-workers, as well as the Mint Chocolate Chip and Strawberry Shortcake varieties.  All have been tasty, but Key Lime Pie has been the star.  Excellent!! I just got a pack of the key lime pie gum, and it is some of the best gum I\'ve had. It really tastes like key lime pie, almost eerily so, and is flavorful but not too strong. The idea of dessert flavored gum sounds a little like Willy Wonka, but it tastes really good, and I am looking forward to trying the other flavors. never did I think I could put a piece of gum into my mouth and actually experience pie.  You can seriously taste the crust, the filling, and even the whipped cream on time.  I don\'t know how they did it, but it\'s amazing. I am addicted to this gum. It tastes so close to the real thing and doesn\'t lose flavor compared with the apple pie or strawberry. This best flavor of all of this series, along with the mint chocolate chip. I like the Dessert Delights line, and this is one of their better flavors. But the carton I received contains only packs that are stale. The sticks are stiff and difficult to chew, and the flavor disappears within 10 minutes. I\'m quite disappointed that they would dump old products on their customers. I couldn\'t find the gum at the grocery store. So I ordered it from Amazon. The order came quickly and the gum was great! Thankfully I was able to order quite a supply of this gum. My sister and I enjoy this flavor the most and was sad to read it was discontinued.  I paid a responable price so, I thank you. It\'s almost eerie how this gum tastes so similar to actual key lime pie. I just picked up my first pack today, I this is definitely my new flavor. Extra really hit the mark here. A different, unique, and incredibly delicious gum. This scrumptious, delicious treat is sure to please. Don\'t hesitate to buy a pack! I panicked when I couldn\'t find my Extra Key Lime pie gum in the stores.  Then I thought... where can you get just about everything?  Amazon of course!  And to my delight, my gum was there!  If you love key lime pie like I do, this is the next best thing to sinking your teeth into a creamy, rich, key lime tart, delicious piece of pie... without the calories!!!! Wow,  I like the flavors! I\'ve tried the Apple Pie, Mint Ice Cream and the Strawberry Shortcake (not too fond of this one..) but the others are great! I love the Apple Pie and this Key Lime Pie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it says hydrogenated starch... not oils.. difference? This gum is delicious and since my first pack I have been hooked.  I love the Mint Chocolate Chip after meals, and the Key Lime Pie is delectable at all other times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $15/10 pack on Amazon, it\'s not really a deal, though, considering this is only a $1 a pack at target or mcwallymart.  Once the price of a 10-pack drops to about $10 or $11 I might consider buying it online if only out of pure laziness, but a 50% premium is not really worth it. I loved the flavor and the fact that it was so long lasting. Everyone in the office eats it now. We only eat half a stick so we are not sitting around with a big wad of gum in our cheeks, but so far I have not been able to outchew this gum for flavor.  If you like a bright, citrus-y taste that is not too overpowering, you will love this. If you like a more minty gum, then go for the mint chocolate chip flavor of this gum. I was actually VERY surprised that this tasted like the real deal. It\'s very sweet, very limey, and the first couple hundred chews you can taste the crust and a smidge of whip cream. After a few minutes, it still has flavor. After an hour: it still has flavor. I love it! You also get the tangy effect of a lime. Not as strong but very pleasurable. I did NOT expect this gum to be more than just your typical "lime" flavored "candy" type taste. But I was floored. This gum literally tastes like key lime pie. I swear I can even taste a graham cracker crust. The flavor only lasts a short time, but it\'s an amazing taste! Floored! This is the absolute best gum flavor ever.  It really tastes like Key Lime Pie and the flavor lasts a long time. Yummy! Not bad, but there are better gums than this one. At the beginning is a big explosion of flavor and sugar like sensation, but after 5 minutes is gone. Not being a hard core gum chewer, I was thrilled with this gum. A great taste in a gum that last plenty long without any loss of flavor or any kind of after taste. A pleasure in my diet routine. I\'ve tried Wrigley\'s Apple Pie flavor of their Dessert Delights chewing gum.  It tastes EXACTLY like apple pie.  I can\'t wait to try the key lime pie flavor!  Everyone who has posted a review here on Amazon says it tastes exactly like key lime pie!  Wrigley Chewing Gum Co. appears to have hit yet another one out of the ball park!  John V Karavitis, John Karavitis, Karavitis If ever there was a gum to worry about having in your stomach for seven years (as the popular myth states), this one is the most likely. It tastes great, sure, but in the first few bites, it falls apart, losing any cohesiveness (gummyness), and just gets swallowed. For some reason, about 1/3 of it remains intact and becomes gum. What little remains is as the other reviewers state, but knowing that I\'ve swallowed more than half the sticks I\'ve chewed is not a pleasant thought. I really like this gum. like all of Wrigley\'s gum products I\'ve tried, this is absolutely great. These Dessert Delight flavors are truly delightful. the extra dessert delights sugargree key lime pie flavored gum is an amazingly limey mouth party.  it has a zesty tartness tempered with enough sweetness for balance.  having a piece of gum taste so much like a food is a little disorienting and while i did not really think i would end up looking like a lime (a la violet beauregard from willy wonka and the chocolate factory movie), it was a relief that i did not.  the only problem is that the flavor does not last as long as bubble gum or mint flavors.  but that might just be too much to hope for. Like other reviewers, I had low expectations for this gum, but was happily wrong.  I love key lime pie, and lime flavor in general.  When first chewed, this gum has the tangy-bite of key lime, with a creamy sweetness, and a hint of graham cracker crust flavor.  After the initial flavor burst fades, there is that surge of artificial sugary-sweetness that occurs with some brands/flavors of sugarfree chewing gum, but the surge isn\'t as overwhelming or long lasting as it is with some sugarfree gums.  Once that fades, the gum has a mellow, subtle, lime zest flavor.  I really like this gum. So far I\'ve tried all of the flavors and while there are some I\'m not over the hill about, I\'ve had pretty good experiences with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the flavors I\'d purchase again. I\'m a big fan of anything lemon or lime flavored, so I had to give this a try. I\'ll admit up front that I haven\'t had a key lime pie for years, so I don\'t remember the flavor like it was yesterday and this probably worked in my flavor. (I remember it in general, though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tastes awesome. I can definitely taste the lime and it tastes like what I remember a key lime pie to be. The lime flavor is there, but it\'s backed up by a nice creamy taste that almost made me want to grab a few extra slices of gum. (Hey, it\'s 15 calories a slice so I can splurge on this while I wouldn\'t want to splurge with the actual pie.) Unfortunately it falls prey to the same problem that the equally yummy apple pie flavor had: the flavor doesn\'t last nearly long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\'ll absolutely buy this again, despite the flavor only lasting 1-2 minutes. In this age where even basic service no longer exists, I was pleasantly surprised when my transaction actually came off without a hitch. Shipped on time, and the product was in good condition. Well done! Initially, the flavor is fairly accurate, however weak- from there, the flavor diminishes rapidly. I just timed it, and this gum goes flat within 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;In light of my experience, I find these rave reviews somewhat... amusing; one reviewer even went as far as to describe it as "incredibly tart". Meh.&lt;br /&gt;Like many new products in the realm of gum, pop, energy drinks, and fast food, they only need you to buy one. If everyone does that, they\'ll be sitting pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Based on this experience, I have no desire to try the other flavors of Extra Dessert Delights.&lt;br /&gt;Three stars = It\'s OK, but doesn\'t live up to the hype. On top of the delightful aspartame, this comes complete with hydrogenated oils and is a dead ringer for Country Time Lemonade mix. Instead of just being pork rinds, oil, salt and vinegar, they have lactose and maltodextrin on them, contributing to 2g of sugar per serving.  Many people (myself included) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets; they will not be happy about the sugar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The labeling on the package is very strange, and I am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing.  It says Total Carbohydrates are less then 1g, so they get to put zero grams.  Ok, fair enough, I have seen that before.  But then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar, which is a carbohydrate.  How they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me.  I assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is protein.  The nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving.  Not bad for a snack food.  Right next to the 8g is says "Not a significant source of protein."  Huh...A slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein, as is an ounce of meet.  I believe those are significant sources of protein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to their website, to check out the nutritional facts.  I did notice they were high in sodium.  What I missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1.75 oz package was three (3), so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher.  I doubt many people expect a 1.75 oz package to be three servings.  I just looked up Fritos Corn chips.  A 2 oz package is considered a single serving package, and the analysis on the back shows one serving.  So when Fritos tells you the sodium level, it is only 320 mg for the entire package.  For these pork rinds, the 1.75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium, about half of your daily requirement.  A little steep for a snack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I went to their site to look at some nutritional info, they don\'t shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at Amazon.  If they had, I would not have purchased it.  They use partially hydrogenated oil, a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term.  Since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label, a lot of the food industry has switched away from it, as people are correctly suspicious of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with the taste.  They have a chemical, nasty taste.  I suppose that is subjective, but a few bites left me a little queasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel bad having bought this, but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack.  Please pass this company\'s products by, and let\'s find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a rational, ethical and legal way. I love Salt and Vinegar potato chips, but can\'t eat them on my low-carb diet. These pork skins are a wonderful replacement for those high-carb snacks. The salt and vinegar flavoring in the pork skins is a bit more muted than what I am used to finding in most potato chip brands, but is definitely adequate to soothe my cravings for a crunchy salt-and-vinegar snack. The pork skins are light and fluffy, with almost none of the hard rinds that can be found in some brands of pork skins. If the flavoring was a bit more pronounced, I would give this snack five stars. If you like salt and vinegar chips but want to avoid carbs then pork rinds are for you especially this brand. I\'ll eat these instead of chips any day! Would\'ve rated 5 stars if it had more of a vinegar taste.  Overall, not bad at all, good snack can\'t find them anywhere where I live, so glad I found them here. Not too salty or vinegary just the right amount&gt; thanks The customer service was beyond compare.  I would gladly do business with this company again. I have a hard time finding this up in New England - so glad to see this product here.  This is my favorite product in my spice cabinet.  I have tried many other so-called "Cajun" spice blends and find that they are too salty (although this is salty too, it is not predominant on the palate) or too hot (which a true "Cajun" spice is not hot).  Laissez les bon temps rouler! This is a wonderful product, I was happy to see I could buy it on Amazon because our local stores quit carrying it!  We use it mostly to sprinkle over chicken wings to make a cajun wing..yummy!  It can be used on almost everything. Love It! I, just like all the other reviewers love this seasoning. I have been making Cajun Catfish with this seasoning for about 15 years. I have tried other seasonings when this one was not available, but it\'s just not the same. If you want to try my recipe, it\'s very easy. I melt butter and brush the catfish fillet with it and generously&lt;br /&gt;coat the fish with the seasoning. Meanwhile I preheat a cast iron skillet. When the skillet is hot I put in about 2 tbs olive oil and than about 3 tbs of butter and fry the fish to a golden to dark brown on each side About 4-5 minutes and add some more butter if the pan becomes to dry after turning the fish. During this I make a pot of spaghetti, my wife likes angle hair, after the pasta is done, drain it and remove the fish to a platter, turn off the heat under the skillet, add a little more olive oil and butter, scrape up the bits of fish left on the bottom of the skillet and dump the pasta into the skillet and mix it around to soak up the buttery oil, than sprinkle some more seasoning on the pasta and serve with the fish. Everyone love it. To give this dish a little color, you can add a bag of fresh spinach to the pasta water during the last 2 minutes of cooking, or stir in a small can of diced Cajun tomatoes after you put the pasta in the skillet, or use both. Hope you enjoy it if you try it. This is the best Cajun spice my wife and I have found anywhere, ever.  We have been using it for more than ten years.  It goes great on all sorts of things -- chicken, beef, pork, fish, eggs (hard boiled, scrambled, or fried), baked potato, etc.  Not only is it a very good combination of spices, it is also ground fine and mixed well.  Whenever we fry something in batter or breading, Luzianne\'s Cajun Seasoning usually finds its way into the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We\'ve tried "Slap Ya Momma" and other cajun spices, but those tend to be too coarse.  Instead of tasting a blend of spices, you tend to bite down on a nugget of salt, filling your mouth with the taste of salt, then a nugget of pepper, filling your mouth with the taste of pepper, etc.  Luzianne\'s is definitely the superior implementation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We recently ran out of it, and to our dismay Safeway has stopped carrying this product, which is why we have tried other brands.  None have measured up, which is why I was searching for it online.  We\'re very happy to have found it again on Amazon. THis product (which i am not allowed to return) has ingrediants of salt, spices, hydrolysed soy protein, that last item is the common industry con for adding msg to your food. Every soup on your grocers shelf contains msg, but, i digress. So, the third ingrediant is a form of MSG, further down the ingrediant list is proudly displayed ... Monosodium Gludamate, ...MSG. This does not add spice to your food, it stimulats your tongue into feeling that the food tastes good, when IT DOES NOT. MSG can make dogfood taste like hamburger. anyone who thinks this is making their food taste cajun may be serving ALPO.  Tones and Durkee (sp) do not contain MSG, I prefer Tones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 8 eight ounce cans of this stuff.. would anybody like to buy some hamburger from me? I bought this seasoning because Amazon stopped selling the 12 count Konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a 12 count.  I bought it thinking it would be similar to the Konriko, BOY WAS I WRONG!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows:  hydrolyzed soy protein, and Partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil.  I was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix.  Now I know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein; as the other reviewer stated it\'s a industry way of adding MSG.  Well why in the world do we need that and what\'s up with the HYDROGENATED SOY BEAN AND COTTONSEED OIL!!!!  BESIDE IT BEING BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH IT CAUSES THE PRODUCT TO CAKE AND CLUMP.  I steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them.  An even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health.  When I purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description, now it is.  I think that AMAZON as a regular practice should require all food products/company\'s to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site.  WHY WAIT UNTIL THE CUSTOMER PURCHASE IT TO FIND OUT???!!!  I don\'t think this is a customer friendly practice!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a good buy IMO.  I found my Konriko at another site and will be purchasing it from there; unless AMAZON brings it back at a 12 count offer; otherwise to buy one at $8 and $4.99 s/h is just way over priced and highway robbery!!!! I grew up using this seasoning on steak, and pretty much everything. Could no longer find it in stores so ordered a case off amazon. Very happy nice spice and flavor. Highly recommend. I love this product and can\'t get it locally anymore.  It was a fair price and the item was in stock and came quickly.  I would buy from them again. This is a wonderful mix of spices.  One of my favorite uses is on chicken on the grill.  Try this out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5-6 cloves garlic, minced&lt;br /&gt;1 1/2 Tbsp. Luzianne Cajun seasoning&lt;br /&gt;1 Tbsp. olive oil&lt;br /&gt;2 Tbsp. lemon juice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combine ingredients with chicken in a gallon size zip lock bag and marinate chicken legs &amp; thighs for 2 - 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix up a second batch, and brush over chicken while grilling, cooking on all sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just made this yesterday...excellent! This is the best cajun seasoning ever! We use it on seafood, steaks and burgers. Seasoning enhances, not overwhelms, whatever it is put on. I have been using Luzianne Cajun Seasonings for years.  I find it best on Beef and fish/seafood.  Like one of the other reviewers, I like the fineness and the blend of the seasoning.  The combination of the two gives it it\'s unique flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have friends and family over for steaks, they always say these are the best, what\'s your secret.  I first tell them it\'s an old family secret, but then I tell them about Luzianne.  I am not sure they are listning, because the next time over we have to go through the same conversation.  Oh well, more praise for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Luzianne for all the pats on the back. This seasoning adds just the right amount of spice to almost any dish! If you want something with a little kick you will love this seasoning! Can\'t beat the price for a top notch product! Oh man, I, like many of us have tried so many Cajun Seasoning, but this company does it Right!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Folks at the Heart-Heat of Southern Seasoning!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my love,&lt;br /&gt;Roy Watson,&lt;br /&gt;408-464-0100 I originally discovered this years ago on vacation in southern Maryland. Since then it\'s always been in our cupboard. We came home to PA that year with three cans of it and then resupplied each summer. After a couple of years it became available in our area, but in the last year or so, we haven\'t been able to find it anywhere. This is one seasoning I don\'t mind buying by the case. (and it\'s a great price, too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We put it on virtually anything - and I mean anything. Meats, poultry, seafood, salads, spaghetti, eggs, pot pie, vegetables, soups, whatever. It\'s especially good on any pasta dish. I even sprinkle it on a sandwich. The spice is just the right amount of heat with the touch of lemon to top it off. It sounds weird but I think I could even enjoy this on ice cream. Luzianne Cajun Seasoning is a great way to spice up anything you make. It adds a nice amount of heat to your food without being over-bearing. My whole family loves it! I have been using this spice mix for many years but, I have found it hard to find lately. I decided I would check Amazon and I was very surprised to see it available! I am a fairly good cook and I have developed some easy dishes using this mix and it is very unusual and tasty! A 12 pack is a lot of this spice but, it does keep for years and I use it quite often. Give your family the kick it deserves with "Luzianne Cajun Seasoning" We discovered Earth\'s Best when my oldest started solids years ago.  They had a more limited selection then, but offered more variety than the "regular" brands.  For him, we only bought a few jars each trip, those flavors that we couldn\'t get in another brand.  For our second child, we added a few more.  With the 3rd baby, we started out on the larger brands, but he wouldn\'t eat them.  Who can blame him!?  They\'re runny and lacking any flavor.  Not to mention, no matter how good sweet potatoes are, how many jars can you eat?  He gobbles up every jar of Earth\'s Best without any problems.  When we introduce a new flavor, he\'s all for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other posts that some of the flavors are very runny.  We just add a few tsp. of cereal and problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earth\'s Best is more expensive.  I calculated that every 2 weeks of food costs me $15 more than buying the other brands.  However, we decided that since he eats it all (vs. being very picky with other brands) it\'s a wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to use Earth\'s Best for your baby w/out breaking the bank, try these tips:&lt;br /&gt;*Visit Earth\'s Best\'s website and print off all the coupons they\'ll allow (usually 3), have family and friends do the same&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Buy at Whole Foods.  They have good prices and when you buy a lot, they give you a bulk discount&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*You can also buy them by the case at Meijers for less than $10.00, cheaper than here! I thought I was doing my kid a favor when I invested in a case of Earth\'s Best dinners.  Unfortunately, the second ingredient (after water) for all of these is....applesauce.  Or in the case of the "Sweet Potato &amp; Chicken" variety, it\'s sweet potatoes, followed by apricot puree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting used to the sweetness of these (try \'em - they\'re like jam), it\'s difficult for kids to adjust to "real" food.  From now on, I\'m going to stick with just pureeing home-cooked food.  It\'s a lot cheaper, too. According to a lot of reviews on top baby food brands overall, Earth\'s Best was always voted to be in the Top 5 of all the lists of reviews by Mom Links, Consumer Reports, Livestrong, Baby Health Sites.  Here is a excerpt from one of the sites (I think it was from eHow.com):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Center for Science in the Public Interest evaluated popular brands of baby foods, including Gerbers, Heinz, Earth\'s Best and Beech-Nut. According to the Center\'s report, Earth\'s Best did not use starchy fillers or "replace real food with water and thickening agents in many of their products for children over six months of age. Such adulterated products are nutritionally inferior to products made with more fruits and vegetables." Earth\'s Best uses certified organic products. The brand offers single-ingredient, smooth foods for infants over four months; fruit, vegetable, grain and meat blends for babies over six months; and a variety of chunky soups, dinners and vegetable medleys for children over nine months old. Earth\'s Best products are sold at supermarkets, natural food stores and big box stores nationwide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, my baby girl loves it.  Yes, it might be a little runnier than the other baby foods, but I just add a little rice with it and that fixes it. We only use jarred baby food as emergency food.  I make all my little one\'s food and freeze it or give it fresh.  Yes, full time working mom but really is it that hard to cook, puree and freeze basic foods like carrots that cost $1.27 for 2 pounds?  I taste all the foods that my baby eats and enjoy the Earth\'s Best line because they taste real.  It\'s not food that you could add to a baby shower game and go "what in the world was that?"  They use quinoa and kamut flours.  It is excellent all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that the apricot puree that other\'s talked about in the sweet potato and chicken dinner is there to maintain the color of the food.  I make my own sweet potato and chicken dinner for my little one and it turns brown.  My baby doesn\'t care about the color of the food but I\'m sure maybe a mom would freak out if she saw this color in a baby food jar - knowing how vibrant sweet potatoes are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half of the jars in my case were popped up.  I wrote amazon and at first they offered me not even the cost of the damaged jars.  I called and they replaced the entire case free of charge.  This had to have happened at the manufacturing plant and didn\'t occur during shipping but rather was a sealing issue.  I was impressed with the speed and efficiency at which amazon handled this.  Will continue to be a loyal customer because of this.  Customer service goes a long ways! We love the Earth\'s Best line in our house. Our 9 mo old daughter  will ONLY eat Earth\'s Best dinners, and I don\'t blame her. The smell from both of the other 2 brand was nauseating. I\'ve sampled the Earth\'s best dinners myself, and they aren\'t half bad... It is baby food.... The fruit blends and veggie blends are great as well. Organic foods are probably most important the first couple of years of life. That is when so much brain development is happening that trying to keep as much pesticides as possible away from your child\'s developing brain and body is a very worthy goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately it is a little easier than it is for a grown up. With our more varied foods and time constraints and on the go, etc. Also no matter how worthy a goal, your child has to eat the food. This is an excellent combination of flavors that I was not always able to find at local stores. And with subscribe and save it is cheaper and delivered to my door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavors are vegetable turkey which lists the ingredients as Water, organic carrots, organic apples, organic ground turkey, organic whole barley flour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet potato and chicken: Water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic brown rice flour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer vegetable: Water, organic corn, organic zucchini, organic green beans, organic brown rice, organic carrots, organic garbanzo beans, organic canola oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rice and Lentil: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic brown rice, organic lentils, organic canola oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other Earth Best blends where water is not the number one ingredient. Obviously that somewhat calls into the question the \'value\' of this particular Earth\'s best item. I just found the tomato and carrot one which I have ordered but not received yet.  Also if you put in organic baby food in Amazon search there are some brands with just food in them for example Peter Rabbit organics (have not yet tried it, but might when she is a bit older).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though I do recommend this variety pack. Our daughter likes them all and she is getting organic ingredients. And for a decent price, even considering the amount of water in them. The water being first in all 4 is giving me pause as to the overall value and definitely something I will keep in mind as to trying other brands going forward. The ingredient lists are all directly from the Earth Best\'s website, earthsbest.com,  as I do not have the products in front of my right now. I agree with a previous reviewer - when it comes to the dinners (just about all of the Earth\'s Best choices) they are watery and SWEET.  Apples (or some other fruit) in just about everything, and the first ingredient is nearly always water.  I\'ve decided to stay away from these as much as possible and purchase protein-containing dinners from another jarred brand (or mixing my own).  I\'d really rather not nurture a sweet tooth at such a young age!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Earth\'s Best fruits and vegetables for the most part are great - just check the label to make sure water isn\'t the first ingredient listed (I just love how baby food will have water listed first but then some kind of flour added as well to thicken it up). As I have with all other Earth\'s Best jarred baby food, I won\'t be purchasing these Dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain BPA.  I contacted Earth\'s Best\'s consumer relations dept. personally, and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines Earth\'s Best baby food jar lids contains "trace amounts" of BPA, but it "doesn\'t come into direct contact with the food."  That kind of lukewarm response wasn\'t enough to put my concerns about BPA to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostled-around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids.  So I guess I\'ll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earth\'s Best rep did say that they were doing "accelerated testing" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such a shame, because Earth\'s Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies &amp; carbs/starch) in PUREE form.  All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ella\'s Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  Earth\'s Best does make some baby food in BPA-free squeeze pouches, but that doesn\'t include its Dinner line.  I was hoping to be able to expose my little-one to a wider variety of flavors and well-balanced meals while still at the puree stage.  But I guess I\'ll have to wait until she\'s old enough for Stage 3 chunky meals, or make her baby food myself.  (Virtually impossible for this super-busy and domestically-challenged mom, LOL!) I ordered this from Amazon and they were pure liquid. Like water. I did not feel at all comfortable feeding them to my daughter. Amazon customer service, however, was awesome and gave me a full refund Bought this after reading the good reviews - not sure if it has to do only with my package but rice and lentil mix literally has a smell of mold. I actually opened two containers to make sure it wasn\'t just my nose playing tricks on me. I love this brand and I am very disappointed. My daughter loves these dinners. There\'s no other organic meat option at my grocery store, so we\'re stuck with this one, but I don\'t mind at all. I think they\'re great. I agree that they are runny, but you can just thicken it with whole grain cereal, and problem solved (turkey dinner is thick enough).  I also don\'t understand why people complain that they are too sweet, or unhealthy. First of all, if you don\'t like the ingredients, buy something else. Second, I trust Earth\'s Best enough to believe they know the right amount of stuff to put in their product. Third, the belief that if baby tastes sweet food, they will not eat regular food, is an old wife\'s tale. Are you people saying that you don\'t give your babies fruit and vegetables? They are all sweet.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this particular item 4 stars instead of five, is the price. I can buy it at my grocery store for 79 cents a jar. Here, they are being sold for over 91 cents. And that\'s at the sale price. If you buy these at the regular price, it comes to $1.41. Way too much! I\'d continue to buy but I\'m moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too. I love the thought that these baby foods are organic.  The shipping is quick, well packaged, and easy to open.  Baby likes ALL flavors so far of ANY type of Earth\'s Best baby food.  However, this brand is always more watery than any other brand I\'ve tried. Our primary reason for buying this product is that it came in a variety pack.  We make most of our own baby food, but we were going on vacation and that was going to be difficult.  Since packing space was limited, we had this shipped to our destination.  It was the only brand we could find to order in a variety pack.  The kids liked all the flavors and the consistency seemed good. My 6-month-old is a fanatic for these flavors!  She gobbles them up and we can\'t load the spoon fast enough for her!  We introduce new foods every 3 days and we always get the interesting blends as well, so she has tried tons of flavor profiles by this point and these really do get a notable reaction from her.  She goes, "Mmm, mmm," lol.  It\'s so cute and meats are an easier-to-absorb source of iron compared to artificially-enriched iron that is found in baby cereals.  I definitely prefer this as a compliment to Mommy\'s milk as oppose to the cereals that are hard for little tummies to digest. I actually cook most of my twins\' savory meals, but I always keep a package of these EB dinners on hand  for (1) feeding the girls on the go and (2) for those times when I just don\'t have the energy to cook or defrost whatever is in the freezer. The girls like most of the flavors, except for the peas. I wish EB had more variety packages with different flavor available. To be honest, my baby didn\'t really love all of these at first. He\'s pretty picky, so I had to mix fruit into some of these to get him interested in a few of them.  He took to the gourmet meals pack right away, but didn\'t love all of these.  But as he\'s gotten older, he\'s gotten less picky and seems to accept all of these flavors now without having to bribe him by mixing in fruit.  The prices on Amazon are good, so I will continue to order these here. My one year old loves this product. She eats one every day and never gives me a problem. And I trust the ingredients which reassures me that she\'s eating something thats good for her. Amazon normally does a fantastic job getting product out to me in great shape and on-time, but, I guess this is one product that they can not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several jars had compromised seals and so we had to immediately throw them out.  I wish I could order this by mail but it seems this is one item we\'ll need to go to the grocery store for. I like the variety in this pack-nice to not have to pick out individual jars and my baby likes them all! The only thing I would suggest is if you have a picky eater, maybe buy one jar at a time to test them out before you buy a huge box. I purchased this food on Amazon then saw it at Babies R Us for 30 cents less per jar.  I like the product but AMAZON is overcharging! My baby has been eating this brand since he was 6 months. I like the convenience of high quality/yet not overly pricey jar food like this. It is easy on his stomach. Never had any health issues with it. The "dinners" are a bit more filling than the usual watery vegetable puree but it still does need a little cereal to thicken up. Summer vegetable is his least favorite. The zucchini (like cucumber) smells pretty strong. He would eat it now but when we first started, he hated it. My son loves the other 3 flavors and that\'s why I continued with my subscription since it\'s more expensive to buy them separately. Organic foods of course are best for your health and starting your baby on foods that are pure is best no matter what. I highly recommend Earth\'s Best products. He loves the formula, foods and diapers. I love the products because it\'s best for my baby. I wish I knew about organics and Earth\'s best 16 years ago with my first baby. My baby loves these dinners. They are very flavorful and not bland like other baby food that we have tried. I love the fact that they are organic and Amazon sells them at such a great price. My 8-month old son is not the picky eater my first was. He had only refused one flavor of all the baby foods introduced to him in 3 months (and it was peas-can\'t blame him for that one) but he REFUSED to swallow the Rice &amp; Lentil flavor in this variety pack. He actually spit it back out and then blew raspberries (cute, but messy). I tried several times over 2 weeks and got the same response each time. We will not be ordering this pack again even though he loved each of the other meals. I did like this product until some jars I found black mold on the inner lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read other reviews, but I thought it must\'ve been a bad batch.  I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earth\'s Best used to be very good. So I canceled my next Subscribe and Save order.  Then I feedback cancel reason to Amazon. I used this variety pack to introduce protein into my daughter\'s diet.  She loves all four of the varieties! This is a nice variety of flavors--two are meat-based (chicken and turkey) and two are vegetable-based (summer veggie and rice/lentil).  My 9-month-old daughter eats all these flavors and particularly likes the meat flavors.  I\'ve had difficulty getting her to eat other meat foods, so I\'m happy to have found two meat meals that she loves.  As with other Earth\'s Best varieties, these varieties include only organic ingredients without any of those funky preservatives. Great value if you buy it as a subscribe and save item, and I love that it automatically comes to me.  These are great and they taste really good, making me think that we bought a very high quality product for our child. I love Earth\'s Best. My son eats almost all of the Earth\'s Best single and combination foods. This pack in particular has two of his dinner/lunch favorites: Summer Vegetable and Brown Rice and Lentil. Some of the dinners and a lot of the first purees are very runny so we mix with some cereal to thicken. My son loves Earth\'s best baby food. He enjoys his vegetables as much as he does with his fruits. He has no problem digesting his food and never spits it up. My son really enjoys all these flavors- eats them all!!! Fast shipping. No shopping in stores. Great prices. Would recommend to all. LOVE earths best but my 8 mth old daughter only liked one of the 4 selections. i highly recommend buying just one of each from the store and having your baby test them before buying these in bulk. walmart usually has them for .60 each I was excited to try this product after reading all of the good reviews. I wasn\'t really impressed when my son tried the food. The consistency was WAY too thin, and my son would hardly eat the whole jar. I would recommend making your own baby food, or use the Gerber organic. Our pediatrician told me to include some form of meat at dinner for our baby. Unfortunately, two of the four varieties don\'t include meat. I don\'t think Summer Vegetable should be included in a dinner variety pack, that\'s what the vegetable variety pack is for. Also, the chicken and sweet potato is extremely runny and hard to feed to a baby. 3 of the flavors are pretty good but the Sweet Potato &amp; Chicken is pretty gross. I was wondering why my daughter didn\'t want to eat it until I tried it myself My baby didn\'t seem into these dinners, so I tried them. They\'re not terrible, but not good either. We\'ll stick with the EB fruits and veggies until she\'s ready for table foods. This is great!  Organic baby food options - delivered to my doorstep!  The dinners are a good combination and receive a raving review from the bib wearer at the dinner table. My little guy loves to try new foods..so this variety pack is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeding organic is the way to go. We trust and love the earths best brand&lt;br /&gt;Ther formula is great. Amazon.com seems to have the best price around i checked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great to get the auto ships of babyfood..less trips to the store for dad ! We ordered the Earth\'s best 2nd dinner variety pack along with the fruit variety pack.  We got the fruit variety pack and an oatmeal and fruit variety pack, not the dinner pack.  Found out we can\'t return the item, either.  We will try the Amazon phone help, but if all else fails maybe my little one will like this stuff... My baby loves this food.  At whole foods they sell the same flat for 10.99 and thats retail.  I ordered this and just received it today.  I hadn\'t even opened package and I could smell a rotten smell coming from box. I opened it to find jar smashed and mold everywhere! I\'m so disgusted and can\'t believe I waited over a week for this to arrive.  What a waste of my time.  The worst part is I ordered the fruit flat as well and also a broken jar and rotten mold everywhere.  I don\'t get how this happens the  shipping box isn\'t dented or damaged neither is the flat box.  So what someone packaged and sent a smashed and rotting shipment? Not a happy customer! Don\'t let the "Earth\'s Best" name fool you .. as stated in multiple reviews here - CHECK THE INGREDIENTS!  No wonder so many positive reviews here have the same theme, "My kids will only eat Earth\'s Best!" .. Well that\'s because they are all SWEETENED, which is one of the worst things you can feed to your child regularly.  They WILL develop a sweet tooth QUICKLY, and will start rejecting pure vegetables / other good things because of this.  There is no need to inject applesauce or other sweeteners into other foods.  That\'s just shameful, and there is only one reason for it - so the child will eat it and only want this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best advice - if you must buy pre-made food, be sure the ingredients are just the main ingredient(s) and (if needed) water.  That\'s it.  Don\'t buy a vegetable that has "applesauce" or another silly ingredient added just to make the child love it and want that brand because it\'s sweetened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Earth\'s Best as a company.  Kudos to their marketing department for creating a name whereas consumers will automatically be drawn to them because they think it\'s a great product based solely on the name. I found this tea when I explored a local grocery store on the north shore of Oahu on a trip to Hawaii last summer. Every now &amp; then I like to add cream to my tea so the idea of a milk tea wasn\'t totally bizarre. (How you\'d guess I\'m American?) I enjoy white, black, flavored &amp; herbal teas but am not a fan of most floral blends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn\'t know what to expect when the package said the ingredients included black tea, non-dairy creamer, rosehip extract &amp; refined sugar. I\'ve never considered putting non-dairy creamer into tea. Would it be a mess I dumped into the mug &amp; stirred to death? Instead, I found all the ingredients in an oversized traditional paper tea bag held in a foil-like moisture proof package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After steeping ~3mins, I was thrilled to discover a light-flavored cup of tea, slightly fruity-scented, with a soothing feel to it and no floral tones to the taste. And no stirring, no clump at the bottom of the cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later I found one of the packages in my luggage &amp; found it just as tasty &amp; easy to prepare as last year. I went online to buy some more &amp; was thrilled to find that Amazon offered the same item &amp; a couple of other flavors by the same company too! These are probably the best crackers I\'ve ever tasted.  They came in a Christmas gift basket, but I liked them so much that I had to google them to see how to get more.  This variety contains oregano, poppyseed, and garlic powder.  Because of how thin they are, there\'s nowhere for the flavor to hide!  Try them with smoked provolone.  I highly recommend them. Google "propylene glycol" to find out why.  I bought this product, along with several others, without running the ingredients by my wife first (a nurse of 30 years) she&lt;br /&gt;was surprised when she noticed it.. we went a googling, and poured my $50 order down the drain afterwards.  There\'s "pure" and then there\'s "not so much".....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from the website:  [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propylene Glycol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cosmetic form of mineral oil found in automatic brake and hydraulic fluid and industrial antifreeze. In the skin and hair, propylene glycol works as a humescent, which causes retention of moisture content of skin or cosmetic products by preventing the escape of moisture or water. The Material Safety Data Sheet warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damage.&lt;br /&gt;Also used in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Tyre sealant&lt;br /&gt;  Rubber cleaner&lt;br /&gt;  De-icer&lt;br /&gt;  Stain removers&lt;br /&gt;  Fabric softener&lt;br /&gt;  Degreaser&lt;br /&gt;  Paint&lt;br /&gt;  Adhesive&lt;br /&gt;  Wallpaper stripper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote the company about this concern and they never responded.... we love grilling all year long but can not get this in markets the price is great and they ship fast now i can get them year round with no salt Since being diagnosed with high blood pressure, this product has been a staple in our home. I especially enjoy the grilling blends. For the price I got it for online it was a great deak, usually much more expensive in store, so buying in bulk from Amazon is the way to go. Received 6 bottles of concentrate from Paragon. Mixed EXACTLY to their specs., and was extremely disappointed in four of the six flavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am truly saddened to have to encourage you to NOT purchase the Watermelon flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item has be returned for a refund. 100% ground Arabica beans. Not my favorite, but not bad for a light/medium brew...smells WONDERFUL as it\'s flowing out of the Kaldi machine. Smooth and not bitter, slight floral(?) aftertaste. I purchased some of this special habanero sauce this past year for my Super Bowl party. It was a hit! I thought I would try the mild since I like some zing, but didn\'t want to burn my mouth off. It was a great mix of some spicy zing with a sweet overtone. Went great with chips as a dip, as well as really good with as a dipping sauce with chicken wings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking about using this as a glaze as well for an upcoming pork tenderloin. I think this sauce is a great change of pace from the person who is sick of the same tastes that you get from the same stuff in the local grocery stores. Plus it is from a small business.....win win win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again Everidae Sauce for a great change of pace! Mild Everidae sauce is like a condiment. It goes on everything and doesn\'t take over the flavor of the food but enhances it. I use this sauce on burgers, shredded pork, grilled chicken, baked chicken, eggs, as a pizza sauce substitute, and basically anything. My kids love the mild kick and flavorful enhancement of the mild sauce. My 10 and 6 year old put it on everything and rave! It will change your cooking and challenge you to try it on everything! So I have sampled and bought my fair share of Everidae sauce and I have to say without a doubt it is the next best thing to put on food.  I will start off by saying I do know the maker of this sauce, and although that may seem like this review is a bit biased, i wanted to be the first to formally state the flavorful blend of this sauce can literally go on everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like spicy hotness, and unlike other condiments like Franks Red Hot, this doesn\'t mask the flavor of the food but adds to it.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this sauce on hotdogs, hamburgers, chicken, tacos, and eggs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mild is a little bit sweeter than the medium and hot(the hot being the heat that I particularly enjoy).  But this stuff can be added to almost any sauce or family recipe to give it that extra kick of spicy sweetness that will make your mouth water. I have been a huge fan of Jelly Bellys since I was a kid, which was about 25 years ago.  I have always had a favorite.  At first it was peach, then banana.  Juicy pear came along and that was my favorite for about ten years.  I thought nothing would top it, ever.  Then I tried red apple.  It is sweet and tart and really delicious, my new favorite flavor.  A ten pound box is surprisingly tempting and I am sorry they are currently all sold out. I wasn\'t sure what to expect from this Jelly Belly flavor. I have eaten "red apples" before but they were usually in a fruit. This was a candied bean with "red apple" flavors put inside. Despite the obvious witchcrafts, I tried this confection because I am not afraid of the unknown like so many people in the RELIGIOUS RIGHT (WRONG). I was surprised to find that this "red apple" had a delicious apple-like flavor and a chew not unlike a finely prepared hamsteak. Would I eat more of these? Yes, I would. I would also recommend this "red apple" to anybody who is adventurous and wants to experience a new and exciting way to feel the best parts of the fruit eating process. RED APPLE JELLY BEANS, THEY DO TASTE LIKE APPLES KIND OF BUT NOT COMPLETELY. STILL PRETTY GOOD. This jelly tastes heavenly. You wont find anything this good at the grocery store. All I can say is I\'ll be ordering more shortly. ****Latest Update****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months.  Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth\'s Best.  It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself.  The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy...  and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well.  All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read the review about BPA in the lids.  I spent some time trying to verify this myself.  A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn\'t find anything definitive, here\'s what bothered me:  Clearly Earth\'s Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids...  their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question.  The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss.  That\'s only slightly paraphrased.  Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either...  nothing.  I\'m not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents\' concerns and tell parents...  something.  Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns...  just say something...  anything.  Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain.  Something, I likely wouldn\'t have done if I wasn\'t writing a review.  Their office was closed...  9AM - 7PM est.  Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATED (old)****&lt;br /&gt;Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I\'m sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I\'m ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that\'s readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least. Here is the response I got to my emailed question about BPA in the lids of their glass jars:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While all of our Earth\'s Best Foods were and are safe; Earth\'s Best Organic® jarred baby food was converted to packaging that does not use BPA in October, 2011.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That satisfies my concerns. They include a 1-800 number if people have further questions: please feel free to contact us at 1-800-434-4246, Monday through Friday from 7AM - 5PM Mountain Time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\'t know why they don\'t advertise this on the packaging, website, etc. It would reassure a lot of parents! I have been very pleased with this variety pack of baby food. The pack contains three each of pears, peaches oatmeal banana, apples and apricots, and peaches bananas and raspberries. My 6 1/2 month old daughter loves all of them, especially the peaches bananas and raspberries! I have been very satisfied with Earth\'s best with one exception. The metal lids have a lining that contains BPA (as do ALL lids on glass babyfood jars), so if you\'re set on staying away from BPA, you\'ll want to get your baby food from companies that make pouches, like HappyBaby and Plum Organics. I make a lot of my own babyfood, so I feel that feeding her SOME food from glass jars is acceptable, especially for varieties that I can\'t make. I do also buy a lot of HappyBaby, and I\'m very satisfied with the quality there also. All in all though, a very nice variety of good tasting fruits! Awesome baby food, I bought it online to save a few bucks, but some of the jars were broken when they arrived. 5 stars for the food, 1 star for packing and shipping quality. My little guy ate this all up before I could even write a review!  :) I was disappointed to find out that the LIDS of Earth\'s Best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains BPA :(&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was avoiding the whole BPA issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers. If it\'s in the lids, it\'s going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging, shipping, storage, etc. I was planning on being a devoted Earth\'s Best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass, but then I found out about the BPA. As a note, if BPA doesn\'t bother you, most of Earth\'s Best food is tasty. Packaging was fine but the baby food were rotten. However, Amazon.com does not let me return it. This is not right!!!! I have put the pic of the food on packaging review page. Buyers should all take a look at it. Earth\'s Best Baby Food&lt;br /&gt;My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth\'s Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I\'ve tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth\'s Best is by far the best for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fruit Variety Pack&lt;br /&gt;Normally I would say this is a great idea, but I wasn\'t a fan of this particular variety. My son would have been just fine with it, but unfortunately for us at this point my daughter is allergic to raspberries and mangos. These are both things I think she\'ll grown out of, but something you may want to consider when purchasing this item. I would suggest trying an individual serving of one from your local store to see if your child has an allergy, but if they don\'t I would say buy it! Other than that I do think it\'s a great variety for kids who need some changing up occasionally. Also, the subscription price on this variety is great and can be altered depending on how soon you need it. We ended up running through another subscription we had and were able to have another shipped as soon as we needed it. Just off the phone with them (Aug/12) and they said that yes they stopped putting BPA in the liners in Oct/11. Of course there is old stock on the shelves so I asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the "old" (with BPA) or the "new" (without BPA) and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid. If it is all white then it is BPA free - if it is metallic or gold then it\'s the "old" lids which did contain a BPA layer. Thought this might help some of you out there! I love Earth\'s Best products. That\'s the only product I use for my baby! My baby loves it and I never had any problem with it. It organic which makes it all that much better! I\'d continue to buy but I\'m moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too. I ordered this because I really like this brand and I have never had any issue with them.  My son usually like all the flavors.  I ordered this and the pears were sour/spoiled.  The other flavors my son refused to eat. I am sure there was something wrong with it.  So I am not sure what happened but I will NOT be buying these online anymore. I love these foods my first son devoured them happily and now my second son also loves them. This fruit mix has a great variety my sons both love the peach oatmeal banana best. Overall a great product high quality ingredients and they don\'t taste half bad, I of course had to try them if my boys loved them. Several broke during transit causing mold to grow over all the other jars. Jars are cheaper at Walmart. My 8 month old loves these. He hardly swallows one bite before he\'s already opened his mouth for the next bite. I make my own baby food when I have time, but when I don\'t, this is a great alternative. This was a good buy. The variety is still close enough so i didn\'t have to worry if baby will like the next one I am a strong believer in giving my baby organic foods as much as possible. We used many of the Earth\'s Best flavors and baby really enjoyed most of them. What I found irritating though was how runny many of the flavors were; I often had to add oatmeal or rice just to keep the food on the spoon.  Water is added to many if not most of the flavors. I wondered if that was a necessity however "Plum" "Ella\'s Kitchen" and "Happy Baby" brands (also organic) do not have water as an added ingredient. We definitely used these, but to be honest, I prefered the other brands because I felt we were getting a better value considering we weren\'t paying for water in those packages. I\'m not the one who eats these so I can\'t give the best review but my son gobbles them up so I\'ll take that as a 5 star rating from him and I give it 5 stars since I know it\'s organic and I don\'t have to worry about what he\'s eating.  Now if I were to review his vegetables I might have to deduct a star for him but that\'s just because he doesn\'t seem to care for peas much. With the Amazon Mom discount, this is cheaper than in stores unless there\'s a sale.  It regularly goes on sale at Kroger, Publix, and other grocery stores for around 50 cents a jar.  I wish there were other Earth\'s Best fruit varieties available on Amazon at this price.  No problems with breakage during shipping for me, but I found the packaging annoying.  In general though, I think Earth\'s Best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you\'re getting:  organic, non-GMO baby food delivered to your door step!  As a single mom in a rural community, going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earth\'s Best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non-organic foods like Gerber.  The textures are good, but I had to stay on 1st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all 2nd Foods made my son gag.  I had a similar issue graduating from 2nd Foods to 3rd Foods.  Sprout baby food, however, is the best quality I\'ve tried for freshness, aroma, and taste.  It reminds me of pureed fresh produce.  While I\'ve seen it in Winn-Dixie for the same price as Earth\'s Best, it\'s much more expensive on Amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online.  I\'m going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it, but I\'ll probably always keep a few jars of Earth\'s Best to get by in a pinch. I love getting this case. It actually saved me money by buying it this way...and my son loved the fruit varieties. I felt good about giving him this, because it is organic. The price is also good for the product. I bought this for my 8 month old grandson to try.  He loves it!  I\'m so pleased that I am ordering it for my infant great-niece and also for part of an all organic baby shower gift.  This food is inexpensive, convenient, and organic.  Best of all . . . He likes it!  I\'m setting up the recurring delivery method for my grandson.&lt;br /&gt;CORRECTION!  The product I ordered two weeks ago was $7.76 a case.  Now the cost is $11.03.  That\'s quite a price hike.  Is there any way to be notified if the price goes back down? We just started using these and my 7-month old daughter really likes them. I\'ve tried a couple of bites and they are tasty with good flavor combinations. I love that they are organic. My only complaint not specifically related to the product is that when I got mine in the mail, one of the jars was broken and I had to clean the food off of the other bottles. My one year old loves this product. She eats one every day and never gives me a problem. And I trust the ingredients which reassures me that she\'s eating something thats good for her. I have a habit of trying everything myself before offering it to my LO. With this product I am sure that I am providing my LO with Good nutrition and Good taste.&lt;br /&gt;He simply loves it . It\'s gift for my princess.It tastes good and  baby love it.Packaging is also very carefully so they arrived home safely. Our baby LOVES LOVES this food. We actually mix a jar with 1-2 scoops of rice cereal for breakfast and he gobbles it up. Earths best is the best! Great variety of fruits, and my 8 month old loved them all. We bought this assortment pack as well as the vegetable one and it lasted well over two weeks. my son can not get enough of these fruit purees.  i can not think of a higher standard of praise for this product! I was very pleased with the price of this product. And the shipping speed was fast! I like that I didn\'t have to lug this back from the grocery store. Thanks, Amazon! The bananas are a little runnier than most brands, but overall, my son loves this stuff.  And what a great price! Liked the Baby food(yes for myself ;-P) really tasty and smooth consistency for an organic treat,except the Peaches and Apricots not soo much nice flavor and such.Really good though and timely shipping excellent buyer!! My baby loves Earth\'s Best product.  The food is tasty and doesn\'t cause her constipation problem.  I\'m happy that I can find the organic and affordable food for my baby. we make our own fruits and veggies to use at home or at daycare.  however, storing them while we travel is challenging so we use the earths best on trips.  the flavor is wonderful, the ingredients are simple and organic and we feel good giving this to our 7 month old.  she loved all of the flavors in this variety pack so much that we are trying to replicate them at home.  we also keep these in the pantry as back up. I am loving Earth\'s Best brand overall.  I set out with the goal of making all of our son\'s food.  However, when I returned to work full time the puree time was less.  So my go-to backup is Earth\'s Best Baby Food.  We\'re on stage two now, almost stage 3, and he loves them.  I appreciate the no added sugars / preservatives and that it\'s mostly organic.  He loves the taste and combos.  Good stuff, great product, LOVE IT! The flavor combinations are good and taste pretty good too.  I did not give it 5 stars because I thought the consistency of the pears was a bit thin and runny for stage 2.  That is easily solved if you mix the fruit with some cereal.  My little girl loves them. Great value if you buy it as a subscribe and save item, and I love that it automatically comes to me.  These are great and they taste really good, making me think that we bought a very high quality product for our child. We love Earth\'s best. Its hard to beat their variety of flavors and organic offerings. You can also buy a vegetable variety pack, gourmet meals, or my favorite, the seasonal! Good Price on Amazon too, especially if you do subscribe and save!! I like this one better than all the other ones by Earths Best. The variety is good and my son seems to enjoy them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If i am going away for a weekend this is perfect for feedings. It is packaged well and again the variety helps! The variety pack is the way to go when buying in bulk. My 9-month old daughter loves all of the flavors. I bought this for my 1 year old and he loves it just as much as the other organic brands we\'ve purchased, but I got this one for 30-50% less!  Great buy. Beware of what you are being charged .... it says that it\'s $9.99 but 911Drugstore is charing you $39.99 plus $14 in shipping. (I\'ve found this to be true for several other items on this site.)&lt;br /&gt;I\'m not sure if this is a misprint .... Amazon doesn\'t seem to think it\'s an issue since the seller can charge whatever they want for the item.  I disagree, and think it\'s Amazon\'s responisbility to get to the bottom of this. My son happily eats all of the fruit/veggie varieties of Earth\'s Best, unlike the Organic Baby products, none of which he likes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful to only get the fruit and veggie variety packs, not the dinner packs, as they have meat in them. I just called up customer service and found that since October 2011, all the jars are BPA free. BUT...the jars manufactured before October,2011 are still available in the market. Usually all these products have a long shelf life as they are vacuum sealed. So the jars with BPA lining on the lids are still floating around in the market. The consumers cannot tell the difference. So what is the point in buying this when you do not know if you are giving your baby something that is BPA free or not??? This is very very disappointing from earth\'s best. I usually feed Earth\'s Best baby food to my grandson. He has never had a reaction of any kind to any baby food I have given him. This is the first time I have tried this particular variety pack. I fed him the Peach Oatmeal Banana and Apples and Apricots for breakfast this morning. Shortly after I noticed he was scratching. I looked and he had a rash. I remembered reading a baby food review where someone mentioned an allergy so I checked and yes it is this variety pack. I don\'t know what is in it that would cause this type of reaction. Unfortunately I fed him two different jars so I don\'t know which one caused it but I don\'t want to take a chance of him having another one so out they go. Just thought I would let others know. I was reading the other day about which items you shoud buy organic&lt;br /&gt;and fruits and vegtables were the top of the list. So dahh..it dawns&lt;br /&gt;on me what have I been feeding my baby ? We changed to Earths best&lt;br /&gt;I feel better, feeding the best.&lt;br /&gt;Also we use Earths best Formula..when we changed our baby now sleeps&lt;br /&gt;thru the night...and that REALY makes me happy ! We are huge fans of earth\'s best.  My daughter loves them.  It\'s a great variety.  I would definitely reccomend this &lt;span class="tiny"&gt; Length:: 0:32 Mins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This video demonstrates how to apply a Siliskin to a glass baby food jar.  These Siliskins are designed to fit a variety of glass baby food jars and protect the glass while traveling or storing.  The Siliskin protects the glass jar against dings and bumps while in the diaper bag or tote as well as giving added protection against occasional drops.  The Siliskins can be reused over and over again and are dishwasher, freezer and microwave safe.  Siliskins are also non-toxic and BPA free.&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CVKAI0"&gt;Silikids Siliskins for Glass Baby Food Jars, Aqua/White, 2 Pack&lt;/a&gt; Amazon normally does a fantastic job getting product out to me in great shape and on-time, but, I guess this is one product that they can not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several jars had compromised seals and so we had to immediately throw them out.  I wish I could order this by mail but it seems this is one item we\'ll need to go to the grocery store for. I like their variety package, but also heard that there is BPA in the lid. I will switch to other BPA free products. There is BPA in the lids and company claims it doesn\'t touch the food so it\'s okey. Why do they even write ORGANIC 6 times around the lid? Not honest to their costumer. I wouldn\'t even give 1 star if l could. I have a 6.5 month old who eats #2 food all of the time. I bought this variety pack and noticed that the peach oatmeal is thick like a paste. Coincidentally, as I was thinking that as I was feeding him he started choking and gasping for air.  He couldn\'t breathe and I had to give him the heimlich maneuver and luckily he started crying.  VERY SCARY and those jars went right in the garbage. This food is phenomenal but WAY overpriced. I pay $7.99 a case in New York City and it is often on sale for less than $6 a case at BabiesRus in New York City. Grocery prices are obscene in NY so if I am paying less here, this is no deal. They have a bad taste,i finish giving them away because my son started to cry everytime i tried to give these.I prefer Beech nut or Gerber.Yuck! Coriander is a spice many people pass up or simply overlook and very rarely use except when they might make a corned beef brisket every so often. Sometimes you will find a bit of it in popular seasoning blends as well but it\'s usually a task to find just a small bottle of reasonably priced coriander in grocery stores which deters folks even more from experimenting with this terrifically tasty and fragrant spice. The Frontier coriander powder is wonderfully citrusy and robust, full, very rounded and well-balanced  and very palatable, mouth watering flavor with hints of lemon, not extremely overpowering of all of your other flavors in whatever your making either, which is very nice because this allows you to use it liberally if wanted. It goes good on meats and vegetables and also smells great when you throw a handful in the bbq smoker and let the coriander smoke do its job on the meat and veggies on the bbq. The Frontier coriander powder is of exceptional value and quality, if you like coriander and think you\'d like to start experimenting with it in your recipes I\'d recommend buying some and re-discover the world of delicious coriander. Coriander is my favorite spice after cumin and I go through loads of it. I put it in practically everything I cook. The only problem is it\'s so freaking expensive. If you buy it in a grocery store you need to pay 5 bucks for a dinky little container! So I shopped around a bit online until I found this and it\'s the best deal I could come up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, two whole pounds of coriander for under 12 bucks!? It sounds too good to be true. However, the price was too low to resist and I figured that even if it was poor quality, I could just use a double or triple amount, because TWO POUNDS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the coriander itself comes in two 1-pound metallic bags. So far I\'ve only opened one and the other is chilling in my freezer. The coriander is fragrant and flavorful, even better than I expected. The only danger is that I might overspice as I eagerly throw handfuls of the stuff into everything I make. Why? Because I have TWO POUNDS! If I ever run out I will definitely consider buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real con is that there is so much coriander that it might take too long to use and lose flavor over time. I honestly don\'t think that will be a problem for me considering how much I use, but it might be smart to split the order among multiple people. For this price, you really can\'t go wrong. After coming back from living in England for several months, I craved me some coriander (carrot &amp; coriander soup, coriander-spiced omelettes...)  But even in the Bay Area, this spice been surprisingly hard to find, especially at a decent price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying it in bulk from this seller, the price is unbeatable, and the quality seems comparable to the name-brand, top-notch stuff in England.  One thing to note is that the coriander comes in metallic pouches (not resealable), so if you want to keep it in a resealable bag/container, you\'ll have to provide your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wish I had found someone to split this with me, since it seems like even 1 bag will last me forever! Unless you can use it all, plan on sharing. Great ingredient for my southwest spice mix recipes, and any dish you might want to spice up. The quality of these spices is excellent and rather than buying smaller amounts at huge comparative cost and inferior in quality at a supermarket, this is really the way to go! I store unopened packages in the freezer for freshness. Along with cardamom, this is a spice I use daily so I appreciate the deal here. Happy with this purchase, it\'s a good deal. It\'s the most fragrant coriander ever! Coriander is a super spice, tri-dosha (and a health supplement as well, research it, it\'s a ground cilantro seed). We use it in lots of dishes.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! This is the best-tasting brown rice I have ever had.  Kind of a nutty flavor.  This is the only rice I have ever had that tastes great all by itself. This is OK rice.  It cooks fairly well in my cooker, not as good as some other tho.  But the taste is really very earthy.  I don\'t mind that too much, but this is almost too strong tasting. I Love Basmati rice and to get the Organic is the Best.  This product is great tasting and the aroma was amazing!  The only reason that I won\'t purchase it again is:  the amount in the package is very little and for as much as I steam rice (for not only my kids and me but our French bulldogs) it is just Not enough for the price you have to pay.  Way too expensive.  So, I go to Vitamin Cottage and get the Ludenburg Organic Brown Basmati rice in a 2 lb bag for 4.45...great deal and great product! This product is very good. I have really been pleased. As usual of Amazon,it arrived in good timely fashion. Thank you. I eat basamati brown rice quite often and found this to be relatively flavorless.&lt;br /&gt;It cooked very well in my rice cooker, but did not embody that wonderful nutty aroma and flavor.  The grains are finer and have less body than what I have enjoyed in other brands...maybe personal preference.  Would not try again. I just picked this up at my local grocery store because it was the only organic brown rice they had and I was pleasantly surprised! It cooks really well, not sticky at all (I use a bit of coconut oil and cook it in organic vegetable broth.) Tastes great! I am not typically a brown rice lover but this kind was really good. My kids and husband ate it and asked for seconds as well.  Was delighted to see it on Amazon and for such a great price with subscribe and save! It is great thin and tasty brown rice. Just follow the recipe on the packet and it cooks perfect. Thank you. The "reviewer from Florida" was being extremely kind in their review.&lt;br /&gt;This gruel is not even fit for farm animals.  I\'ve lived in Hawaii most&lt;br /&gt;of my life and have shopped mostly in the local health food stores-so i have had&lt;br /&gt;many many different batches of Basmati rice.  What Amazon has sent me is NOT&lt;br /&gt;edible in my opinion.  It is not long grained as Basmati should be and does not&lt;br /&gt;cook as it should - it fully cooks too soon and does not need the full amount of&lt;br /&gt;water that Basmati usually does.&lt;br /&gt;I am tempted to contact the FDA to see what it really is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My apologies to the "reviewer from Florida" - i should have listened to you and&lt;br /&gt;passed on all this frustration - Amazon does not allow returns on groceries.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say - i am now stuck with several pounds of inedible rice. Here is a great way to get that tast of your childhood without all the sugar.&lt;br /&gt;Even without blood sugar problems i want to cut back on any excess sugar.&lt;br /&gt;This allows you to have a drink option (other than water) with a perky taste that&lt;br /&gt;is low calorie and sugar free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parents dont tell the kids and just serve it, they will never know the diffrence.&lt;br /&gt;Its that good I love fact that this drink is neither too tangy or tos sweet.The combimation of both is perfect and therefore quenches yor thirst  without leaving an unpleant after taste. t My entire family and my extended family (Cousins) love the entire product flavor line. Why have they taken this product out of the stores? Several large food store chains have taken the products off their shelves. Why? We absolutely love the sugar free cherry Kool-Aid but have a very hard time finding it in stores.&lt;br /&gt;When we discovered it on line we bought a bunch. It is a wonderful product! Hope they keep making it!&lt;br /&gt;Delicious! I was going through about 2 litres per day of various soda drinks.  Switching to this has really brought down my caloric intake and I have dropped about 5kg with this being the only change in my diet. I\'ve been searching for alternatives for high calorie high sugar drinks.  After tasting many different products, this one is my favorite by a long shot.  I can\'t believe it has no sugar at all.  The little packets make a nice quantity of the beverage.  Some of the other brands I have tried gave me heartburn or they weren\'t sweet enough.  This one is perfect.  I tried the cherry flavor also which is good, but not as good as the tropical.  You have to be careful with spilling it because it does tend to stain, but any traditional stain remover did just fine at preventing the stains from setting in to carpet, clothes, and countertops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ditch the sugary alternatives and you can save hundereds of calories per day just by using this instead.  Cutting calories just became a lot more easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I still use this product multiple times a day.  It\'s great to have a premixed drink in the fridge that you can go to that tastes great, and you don\'t have to worry about calorie intake, or getting the kids all hyped up from sugars.  I also took 2 packets on vacation and mixed it on site.  Saved time and money instead of stocking a fridge up when you would just have to throw away the unused portion at the end of the trip.  I just wish they made a orange and maybe a berry flavor as well. i cant keep enough of this in my house. my kids drink it like its going out of style. i love it cause its so easy to make just water and the packet the best part is that is sugar free. The Tropical Punch flavor tastes just like I remember as a kid.  Easy to use, and fully dissolves in cold water (although I\'ll use a chopstick or knife to stir the mix while the water is filling). I love this kool-aid mix and they stopped selling it at my local Albertsons (boooooooooooo) luckily I found it here and it is even cheaper than it was in store!! Was looking for a way to bulk purchase Sugar-Free Kool Aid. This fit the bill and then some. I am trying to cut back on soda for the family, so this was an excellent way to do it. Cheaper than the store (although not by much) and always available (something the local grocery store could try). This was my second set of these and they are just as fast and just as good as the first. Oh and the Sugar-Free part, can\'t tell the difference, Great product! I chose to purchase in quantity as it is cheaper than the grocery store.  I liked the product so I knew what i was getting. I am glad to be able to get one of my favorite drinks again.  For some reason a few years ago all of the stores in my area stopped carrying the sugar free KoolAid.  I like the new pouches that are in the tubes rather than the old tubs that were stacked, they are easy open and pour nicely into the bottom of the pitcher.  There is less of the particles stirred up into the air from the pouches, as they stream the powder out rather than it just dumping in a blob from the tubs. Great basic hydration for summer. Satisfied with the amount of sweetness. I mix with water and ice cubes for instant satisfaction. I have been having blood sugar and yeast issues, and I\'ve had to cut out sugar.  I had never tried sugar-free Kool-Aid before, so I was a bit nervous about this one.  Luckily I found the taste to be really good.  Even my picky kids love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that these come pre-sweetened in individual pouches.  You just tear one open and stir it into 2 quarts of water.  It couldn\'t be faster or easier!  It even dissolves well in cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered a case of the cherry flavor, too.  My kids and I can\'t get enough of the tropical punch flavor, so we\'re excited to try cherry, too. My local Harris Teeter stopped carrying and said they could not get this product any more.  So happy to find it on Amazon.com!! This reminds me of Summertime in my childhood when my mother would bring a ice-tinkling pitcher of Kool-Aid out to the backyard, and serve it to us while we sat splashing in the wading pool!  So, I was very pleased that Amazon offers this, since it is getting harder and harder to find in the Seattle area. I do most of my grocery shopping on-line at Safeway, and they don\'t offer it or any Suger-Free Kool-Aid flavors. I think the price is a little high, but I ordered it on sale and also subscribed to have it delivered bi-monthly, so the price is more reasonable. I also purchased the grape flavor, but Tropical Punch is still my favorite. Next time I will get the Cherry flavor, because I like it mixed with Crystal Lite lemonade! It disolves very well in cold water, and to me does not taste sugar-free at all.  And of course it is even more refreshing and delicious served up in my vintage 1960\'s Kool-Aid pitcher and little Kool-Aid cup!!! I would never buy this cake. It looks horrible. Some of the fondant work on this seller\'s other cakes is shabby the piping is horrible...worse than a cake you would buy at the grocery store. The flowers look like red and green blobs. How can you possibly think you should sell these to people? I\'m so glad I found this seller.  I just purchased my Keurig about a week ago and wanted to try some different flavors without committing to an entire box.  It was fun picking out all the flavors I wanted to try.  If you go over to her website, [...], there is a much easier to read list of flavors and types of coffee that she has in stock.  After purchasing, I immediately sent an email to the seller with my flavor requests. I received an email response shortly after and everything was packed and ready to go less than three hours later!  How\'s that for customer service? And the shipping was lightning fast!  I just received my package today (Monday) after ordering Thursday night.  All cups are accounted for and I\'m already enjoying one of the cups I received.  If you are new to Keurig, or want to experiment with some new flavors, this is a wonderful way to pick exactly the ones you want! I have two indoor small dogs, Poodle and Maltese, and they have high anxiety, especially my maltese and these seem to help! Even if it doesnt they sure love \'em. My maltese before he ate it set it down and rolled all over it, I think he likes it! I\'d give it 5 stars but its just a little pricey. I LOVE green tea and green tea beverages. When I saw this on sale I was happy to try it. Once I received it and tasted it I was not so happy. First off tasted like the smell of dirty water. Best way I can describe it lol This has cane juice yet tastes like it doesn\'t have anything. Added calories for what no flavor? No Thanks. So yeah all in all pretty flavorless (beside the dirty water smell taste). Was a huge disappointment. Worse yet I bought 2-12 pk cases. Now I have to doctor the rest up. Maybe just buy some lemons and make them into a green tea lemonade? Oh well, I tried. This product is very flavorful and you don\'t need much of it in your recipe it\'s really strong, it\'s organic. It\'s got the typical Jif taste, which to me is unremarkable -- it\'s ... just peanut butter -- however, the single serve containers are convenient and transport well. The consistency is great -- it\'s not runny yet it\'s also not a solid hunk-a peanut butter with floating oil either. Good for dipping pretzels or celery/other veggies, and -- in the absence of a spreder -- you can just tear off the top and squuush the contents onto bread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is right. Maybe it\'s just me, but I have used this extract in my oatmeal (same amount as McCormick extracts) and I can\'t taste any flavor at all.  Very disappointing. I used this in making a wedding cake for some friends.  It tasted awesome mixed into the fodant!  I would purchase other flavorings from this vendor. In the attempt to make blueberry cake for my brother, I used the WHOLE bottle and STILL didn\'t have a blueberry cake.  I added about half the bottle to the cake mix (white cake--NOT vanilla), and the other half to the frosting (white frosting--NOT vanilla) and it still only had a HINT of blueberry flavor.  I was completely disappointed in all the time, effort and money spent making it, and it barely tasted blueberry.  I would have thought that using the WHOLE bottle would have made a blueberry flavor.  I guess I will have to see if I can find actual blueberry extract and not blueberry FLAVORED extract.  Will not be wasting my money on this again.  :( arrived on time,smells like a good addition to my baking supplies.  came in excellent condition.  will use in syrups, etc. We have been looking for pesto that tastes as good as what we had in Tuscany. This is from the same region as our favorite. The consistency is just a bit runny. It has moderate chunks of garlic. It was quite tasty! Something is Very Wrong  The product is excellent.  I have been buying it for several years, first at Whole Foods, and then when they dropped the product, I have been purchasing it online.  In fact, I purchased it in its original larger size jar.  When the size was decreased to 8.82 OZ,  the selling price remained the same at Whole Foods.  I also purchased ALL flavors as this product is really delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price has been going up CONSIDERABLY. I purchase 36 jars per order to save on shipping. With each order there is always another price increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recent order of September 2012 for 36 jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store. The store did not repack it. Each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item. It stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor. The following information shocked me, and I quote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RIGONI FRUIT SPRD 8.82 OZ Pack 6 Retail 5.99&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you note the price? Retail 5.99!!!! It did not state wholesale, it said RETAIL PRICE. No one sells it for 5.99, yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price. Am I missing something here?  How many hundreds of dollars have I wasted???  I guess it is a matter of what the market will bear.....OUTRAGEOUS!  Of course there is the additional shipping chg.  On principal alone I will give up on this product. The GREED is beyond comprehension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product a low rating, even though the product is excellent because it is incredibly OVERPRICED. Good stuff, but may be a bit expensive in relation to more local products.  Love the no sugar added, but found product at local store for half the price.  Would continue to purchase if I did not have cheaper option. This hit my sweet cravings perfectly. Definitely keeping this around. Yum.  I would definitely reccomend this to anyone wanting a quick snack that isn\'t a lot of calories.  Get the 94% fat free and it\'s only 100 calories. I really liked this popcorn, and the price is much better than purchasing at a regular supermarket.  If you have at least a 1,000 watt microwave, it is best to use Power level 7 (70%) to start with, and set a timer for one minute until you arrive at the best power level and time for your particular microwave.  Otherwise, smoke or worse may lead you to believe this is a bad product. This popcorn is great, and even comes in Smart Pop at lower calories. I always have both for the me and the grandkids. I know the price varies for stage 1 foods but sometimes they are a lot cheaper on amazon then in the stores. I wasn\'t sure how many were in the package so I decided to just buy one.  There are 8 packs of 2 in this package so for the price, you are getting 16 containers.  I personally wasn\'t sure if I was getting a great price or paying slightly  more then if I went to the supermarket.  I like these gerber containers of baby food.  It\'s easier to get the food out, they do make some organic varieties, and you seem to get almost double the amount of food for the same price as jars.  If you only use half the lid snaps back on easy like a desposible food container. These prunes saved so many of my baby\'s uncomfortable constipation days when he started on solids. The puree seems to be easier to consume than prune juice and we used to give it to our baby with yogurt. It soon became his favorite food and eased his symptoms.  I highly recommend this product to parents who are having a hard time with their babies\' constipation. Our pediatrician recommended we feed our constipated 6 month old prunes. He wasn\'t too thrilled with the taste but it did the job:P I think BJs has a better deal on mixed fruit packs by Gerber, but if your child really loves peaches, this is great! I believe gerber may have mixed apricots with the peaches. It now has a sour after taste and my son hates it. These are really awesome - the flavor is unexpected, but perfect; gives a boost to "plain old" pork rinds - lots more crunch with way less the calories of salt/vinegar chips!!!  In addition, the company is quite pleasant to deal with, and all the other products I\'ve tried are delicious and a good bargain, too. I found out about this spice blend in Dallas a few years back when I persuaded a waitress to tell me what the restaurant was using on the grilled shrimp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this Cajun spice for grilling fish. Recommend, but store it in a dry place and replace it every year or so at least, or it will lose its flavor. We love this seasoning. Easy, fast and great on chicken, fish, pork, etc. Just melt a stick of butter and stir in this seasoning until it becomes a loose paste. Brush on protein, and sear on a hot pan. Cast iron is best. Always skin side down. when dark, place in a 400 oven until cooked to correct temp. Enjoy! I ordered these gummi bears after first trying them at Yogurtland. I was a little weary about ordering them because of the last two reviews. But I received a perfectly packaged item. They were not melted and didn\'t have a powdery texture to any of the gummi bears. They are my husband\'s favorite! We have been enjoying them since we received them and I\'ll be ordering more for events that are coming up. These baby gummy bears are by far the best I\'ve ever had. I had first purchased the 1.5 lb bag here, on Amazon, but I realized as soon as it arrived that it wasn\'t going to be enough. However 5 lbs on a subscription basis? Oh yeah. I bought these to add to my Easter favors. I love the colors for that reason - basic and pastel - all of which are different flavors.  I didn\'t eat any myself but my friends who received the favors LOVED them!  I have a Prime Account so the gummies shipped very quickly so there was no melting going on (other reviews mentioned this).  Can\'t complain about the price for a 5 pound bag. It was a great deal and if I needed buy gummies in bulk again I would definitely buy these mini bears. My boyfriend tried these gummy bears at our favorite frozen yogurt place and said they were the best gummy bears ever. I sued them to tell me what kind they were and found them on amazon. Then bought a 5 lb. bag of them for him haha. He wanted to go get frozen yogurt every other day just for the gummy bears. Anyway, they are really flavorful gummy bears! These bear cubs are great! They\'re just like the kind you can get at novelty candy stores only much cheaper than their $8-9/lb. In my opinion, the flavors of Albanese gummy bears are much better than Haribo\'s bears. I haven\'t experienced any powdery residue or a melted goop as previous reviewers had. My bears came to me in perfect condition and perfect packaging. If you like mini gummy bears, I suggest you give these a try. These are the best gummie bears I have evvvveeerr had. We sell them where I work so I had to get my hands on some. The flavors are so vibrant and just pop in your mouth They have some textured powder stuff on them that makes them taste bad.. bad after taste. I guess it\'s so they don\'t stick together. Never again So as soon as the delivery guy gave me the package I opened it ready to eat some gummy bears and all I got was a big goo of gummy bears. Due to the heat of the delivery truck it all melted into gel. Of course it is not refundable so now all i have is a bag a liquid-multicolored goo. thanks for making me throw away 15 dollars. Good game amazon. So think about if its summer or kinda warm, stop and wait till december. I have 3 chihuahuas and I thought these would be better for them since they are smaller than a full ear. They still were too much for the little guys. I would say a dog 20-30+ pounds should be able to handle them better than my 8lb guys.&lt;br /&gt;They had a strange smell and felt slightly oily to the touch. I don\'t know if that was something added to them to preserve them or it was natural.&lt;br /&gt;My chihuahuas are fussy and they liked them I was just worried about blockages since they seemed to swallow large chunks of them. They didn\'t have any problems and my 4lb was able to handle them I just wouldn\'t buy them again since my guys are too small. The bags were a good size for the price. I bought three and should have bought one bag.&lt;br /&gt;I rated them 4 stars since they were of good quality just better for larger dogs in my opinion. When we lived in CA we found this packaged brownie mix at our local chi-chi grocery store. On am impulse we purchased them and made them that night. AMAZINGLY good. Made with a cube of butter so be warned! YUMMMY! We went back and bought all the packages on the shelf and had the owners reorder many times for us. We have since moved to another state and have been trying to hunt these down. What a pleasure to find them on our old haunt Amazon. Order, order, order so they will stay available here! The taste is not horrible but it is not very good. There is not a very good mango flavor. I would not buy again. How can you not like this at what great price they sold it at? I also split it up and sent some to my daughter.  It is one of my favorite cooking spices along with oregano, but I tend to make alot of stews and soups.  One must have spice is Thyme of course.  The oregano is for tomato sauce along with basil...  This was a deal. I dont take it to lose weight, this is a laxative tea, as all the ones labeled "weight loss tea" .I\'m very constipated and taking this tea everyday has helped me very much, with no cramps or other negative effects. It\'s strong and dont recommend it for ocassional constipation or for losing weight. Warning: when it works you "have" to go. Oh my gosh.  I bought this tea and drank my first cup in the late afternoon.  By evening I was having the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition - don\'t take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side effects can include:&lt;br /&gt;*diarrhea&lt;br /&gt;*intestinal cramps or gripping pains&lt;br /&gt;*rash&lt;br /&gt;*severe weight loss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senna should not be used by persons with Crone\'s disease, Diverticular disease and other similar diseases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to die my insides hurt so bad.  Any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain.  Be aware before you use.  I threw my remaining 29 tea bags away! Fennel tea is the best herbal tea I have been able to find and Seelect is the best-tasting brand of those I have tried. I dont like the taste of this at all.  I have some other fennel tea from another company not on amazon and it is fantastic.  Cant remember exact name but think it is something like MB - is a french company and I got it in canada and by mail order after that.  It is much better to my taste.  Never dreamed there would be this much variance among fennel seeds as only ingredient. I actually, Gasp, tried this stew. I got to try this at the Texas Scottish Festival in Arlington earlier this year at the Caladonian Kitchen booth (then bought a few cans). The stew was quite good considering it comes from a can. Probably a fairer star rating would be 5 stars, if comparing just against other canned stews. I\'m not entirely fair though, because I\'m comparing it against stews I\'ve had at irish restuarants. So, I have had better. But, still a good product in it\'s own right. I also liked the whiskey cake from the same company. This is not for me. It was like eating a bowl of fat. Not my preference. Everyone is different. Personally i dont like this at all. this egg pasta ingredient was "powdered egg product" and as such not as tasty as those containing the real thing.  i don\'t like anything powdered, but price was RIGHT.  can\'t have it all i guess. My 2 cats really like this cat food best of all! I have regular deliveries in order to be sure to have an ample amount available. This is the only flavor my cat will eat.  She goes&lt;br /&gt;crazy over this flavor.  I think because it is easy&lt;br /&gt;to eat instead of a big chunk.  This looks like little&lt;br /&gt;square slices of beef.  It smells good too.  Whenever&lt;br /&gt;I open a can of this, she comes running!  She\'s meowing&lt;br /&gt;at me repeatedly if she sees the can in my hand, and I&lt;br /&gt;imagine that she is saying "Hey, hurry up and open that&lt;br /&gt;can! I know what you got there.  You can\'t fool me.&lt;br /&gt;Gimme that yummy food!"  But of course, she\'s saying&lt;br /&gt;that in cat language.  Because I love her, I can totally&lt;br /&gt;understand what she\'s saying.  What cat lover doesn\'t?&lt;br /&gt;We definitely have that connection with our cats, don\'t&lt;br /&gt;we?  To her, Tender Slices is the ultimate gourmet meal. The cats don\'t like this flavor. I would have preferred an assortment of flavors. The product itself is good. I just have finicky cats. And I am weaning them off wet food, anyway. My older cat is getting too big! Notice I didn\'t say fat!  ;-) This product is positively wonderful!  Use it anywhere you might use ordinary balsamic, but use it sparingly as it packs a very fruity punch.  Apply just a bit to some fresh berries and pour it over vanilla ice cream for a fantastic desert treat. i had these on the airline and was so excited to not have the juice! i spent a month in italy and bought the olives w out juice but they seem to be hard to find in the USA...these are great since there is no juice! you can take them anywhere and not worry about the mess. i have been super happy with these. the flavor is pretty bold so I only eat 1-2 packs a week. I am going to try another flavor. i definitely recommend trying them! i love olives and this is a great idea Although I like olives, often I only want 3 or 4 due to their intense flavor. These olives have a great flavor that keeps you coming back for more. I love to snack on them at work and have no problem finishing the whole package each time. These olives are delicious! They are not overwhelmingly spicy.  My 8 year old son just ate an entire bag today for a snack.  They are not packed in juice but are moist and flavorful.  The bags are small enough that they are perfect for tossing in a lunch box or bag.  The calories listed for consuming the entire bag is only 100. I was really disappointed in these olives. The are very mushy and I prefer a more firm texture. Cat Cora\'s olives are much, much better. Olives are yummy and a good diet snack, but I just can\'t quite give this 5 stars. Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because first of all, the flavor is occasionally too overly strong with some of the packs I\'ve picked up. I love the taste of chili powder mixed with olives, but sometimes the flavor just isn\'t as consistent from pack to pack. I\'m fine with some changes in taste, but some packs have it packed on while others have been fairly weak. This isn\'t enough to keep me away from this flavor, but it can be aggravating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other issue I have is that I wish that this was resealable. I don\'t often eat all of these in one sitting and I don\'t really like having to bring a second bag with me in order to seal up the portion I don\'t eat. It would be nice if the bag was resealable via a ziplock top or a small piece of adhesive fixed to the bag. I didn\'t deduct a star for this, but it\'s something I\'d like to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise this is a great product. The olives are always freshly kept in the bag and are of a good size. There\'s no puny little olives here, which I like because it\'s easy to get full when I eat these as a snack. The smell alone will make you salivate, it is that good. It comes with rock sugar mixed in, so I don\'t ever use any added sweeteners. I needed something that would last a long time. My dog cannot stop chewing, she has to have something in her mouth. She eats anything that she can get in her mouth. rock, plants,wood chips, walnuts, apples, grasses. These work really good. I\'m order somemore on line here, petsmart quit caring them. I also found out that pork in better for your dog. Instead of beef bone or anything with beef. I first came across Lover\'s Leap Estate tea when buying it from Harney &amp; Sons. I enjoyed that tea very much for its flavorful and clean lightness, reminiscent of an Afternoon Darjeeling. The reason I went with the Elmwood Inn now was that Harney only sells this tea in tins and I wasn\'t interested in adding a tin to my collection every time I purchased this tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I cannot be sure that this is exactly the same tea but I must say that the Elmwood Inn fell short of my expectations. It tastes rather uninteresting and almost flat, and in order to get any kind of recognizable flavor, I have to use plenty of leaves. Yet it still never achieves any flavor experience that would justify buying this tea over, lets say, loose Twinings for much less. I will not buy this particular tea again and will continue to search for an equivalent to Harney\'s Lover\'s Leap. It\'s difficult to find 20 words to say about Mauna Loa Macadamia Nuts, Milk Chocolate Toffee, other than DELICIOUS. They didn\'t last long. I\'m not sure if that\'s a good thing or a bad thing. First, Yuban is my favorite coffee. To be able to buy a case and save is great. The coffee was in date, the seals on the cans were excellent, and the freshness of the coffee was excellent. I will definitely buy more Yuban coffee when I need it from Amazon groceries. I got a case of Yuban cans from Amazon for an amazing price and now that I\'ve been reintroduced to Yuban I\'m sticking with it.  It\'s Colombian which is the coffee I prefer anyway but Yuban  must have a special formula for roasting and grinding that results in such excellent coffee.  Cans have the foil seals that you can peel off so you don\'t need to use a can opener and of course plastic lids to reseal.  Sniffing this coffee as I scoop it into my coffee maker is half the delight!!  Just so excellent and suits my tastes perfectly.  Buying the case is very convenient too!!!! This is the coffee we crave in our house. It is a strong brew, yet not bitter. Yuban is the best ground coffee we have tasted, yet. And a great price from amazon. My wife and I had dinner last night at a very high end restaurant and while everything was magnificent we both thought the coffee wasn\'t as good as our Yuban. I often wonder about Starbucks whose coffee I find undrinkable. My son says it\'s an acquired taste. While working as a busboy in a high end resturant in the 1960\'s the resturant ran low on coffee. The manager sent me out to purchase YUBAN and only YUBAN saying it was the BEST! I have been drinking YUBAN for nearly 50 years and have always found it to be an exceptionally rich, smoothe Columbian coffee. There can only be one! YUBAN! Great Price, The best Maxwell House makes. It is a very good coffee for the price, less then $3.50 a can. I love the taste of this coffee.  It does not have a bitter taste and the size of the can, which per ounce is the same as if you bought the large can, keeps it fresher as a smaller amount is exposed to the air. My Dad has been a Yuban fan for as long as I can remember. The stronger the better! When you break the spoons stirring it, it\'s just right! He even goes so far as to plan his shopping and the stops on the trips that he takes, at stores that serve Yuban coffee. Why, I don\'t know, I\'m a sweet-tea-ice-no-lemon guy so I have no opinion on coffee, Yuban or not, one way or another. I can say that it smells good brewing but then so does Play-Doh and some of the old magic markers. I\'m just trying to report about what I\'ve been exposed to.&lt;br /&gt;Here I buy the packs of 12, every 6 months for him and give them to him at Christmas and Father\'s day. They stay fresh and save the public from being exposed to the mad, half-clothed emergency trips to the store that my 70 year Widower father makes to score the base component for his and the "house guest of the moment\'s" (see *1 below) daily ritual sunrise aperitifs. We\'ve asked about his dedication to Yuban coffee to which he replies, "it\'s perfect black, but better with something in it!" He is apparently referring to its flavor when mixed with any of the typical \'southern flavorings\' (taxed and untaxed, regulated and unregulated) that he occasionally adds to his morning brew. He is definitely one satisfied customer and it makes my life easier (one less present to find each occasion) so take his actions and my word for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(*1)...If she only comes over for breakfast it sure seems like a long way to drive, and please, tell me again, why does she bring so many clothes? No sir, I did not know that, do tell. When exactly did the CDC recommend showering before breakfast? 7/11/07: Great pre-ground Coffee in small enough containers to stay fresh until used.  I drink a lot of coffee, so the convenience of having one rich enough to buy pre-ground coffee means a lot to me.  On my own I go through one can a week so Amazon, let\'s make this a subscription !  Be sure to check the free shipping or you might get a shock though...haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/16/09: Gotta say the price has gone up on this way too much!  I ordered a case at $50 and checked the local supermarket - they were 87 cents per CAN cheaper! Yuban is one of the best coffees available, but not sold in all areas. Amazon\'s case price is unbeatable!!  I get a case every 8 weeks, always on time!! Have you ever had a great-cup-of-joe from a freshly opened can of gourmet coffee, only to wonder what happened to that \'fresh\' taste as you dig deeper into the can? I have experienced this with other main stream brands but not with \'Yuban Original\' coffee! The last pot of coffee has always tasted as good as the first one. There is also a unique quality to this coffee that I have a fondness for. Of course, there will always be something \'better\' out there, but it\'s usually at a higher price. Though the coffee is consistent, it is the wide price range ($0.18 - $0.40 / oz) of this coffee that keeps me at bay with a more cautious 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;With the "Subscribe &amp; Save" option, you can trim costs and be assured of free shipping. Previously, I had subscribed to the 33 oz cans - right up until the option was discontinued by Amazon. I have since switched my subscription to this size and updated this review accordingly. This coffee reminds me of Dunkin Donuts coffee, which is all the rage now.  I like both DD and Yuban about equally, but I opt for Yuban because of the price.  This is really great coffee at a reasonable price.  It\'s a light roast.  If you\'ve never tried Yuban, maybe try one can before committing to the 12-pack.  If you\'ve tried it and like it, then you know this is a good deal. I love cofee.  Yuban is one of the better ones. Maxwell House is also not too bad and there are some other ones that are pretty decent.  Yuban is rich, robust, and stronger than most other coffees I have tried yet not bitter. Overall, I highy recommend it. I first tasted yuban while visiting my brother 20 years ago. he offered me a cup of coffee one morning, and I really liked it. It had a taste that was way different than I was used to. I asked him what it was and he said yuban and to my suprise, it also was decaf. I have never liked decaf, but this was better than any coffee I had ever tasted. We were all in Yuma for the winter. when we got home, we started drinking yuban decaf. I have since switched back to regular yuban, but my wife still uses decaf. we were drinking maxwell house at the time. Found out later that yuban is part of maxwell house. Yuban costs about a penny a pot more that I am more than ready to pay for the better taste. maxwell house is great coffee, and my 2nd choice. we carry our own coffee and coffee makers with us when we travle. We live in S W missouri and can only find yuban regular here, so we order it from amazon, and have had good luck dealing with them. We have had several friends switch to yuban after tasting ours. What can I say.  It\'s our favorite brand of coffee, it\'s affordable, and it\'s delivered to our door!  I think that pretty much sums it up. Yuban is a smooth,rich tasting coffee. Unable to purchase this product in the retail stores in the Chicago area. The price of the coffee is very reasonable. The twelve ounce cans keep the coffee fresh. I am very pleased with this product and will purchase it through Amazon again when I run out of Yuban. We\'ve been drinking Yuban since 1979 and find this the most convenient way to get it. The price is great and it faithfully comes every month.  If we are having guests we can bump up the order.  Fantastic. We were looking for a smooth, rich, non-acidic, non-bitter coffee when we came upon Amazon\'s reviews for Yuban coffee.  Well, we\'ve been buying Yuban Original Roast Ground Coffee from Amazon for about a year now, and folks, what can we say, it\'s still the best tasting coffee around.  Coupled with our marvelous Bunn coffee maker (also an Amazon purchase) which makes a fresh, hot pot of coffee in 3 minutes, it just doesn\'t get any better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Keep checking back weekly to see what the going price is (it fluctuates up and down quite a bit) and when you can catch it at a great deal, buy some.  You won\'t be disappointed. Best coffee in the world.  When you open a can and sniff ---- ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can\'t go wrong with Yuban. This coffee is better than McDonalds, StarBucks, Atlanta Bread, Folgers, Maxwell House and almost as good as Standard Coffee that is served in up scale restaurants only and cannot be purchased privately.  It has a great smooth taste. We have a hard time finding it in SC.  It is manufactured in CA on the west coast.  I called Yuban today and they could tell me what stores in my area have sold it in the last 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;You can also purchase it on line is what I did for 12 cans.  The price beat the price I pay at the grocery store and I had free shipping!!!!!WooHoo!!!!!! Enough to last the rest of the winter and spring.  Try it!  You will Love it! Very good coffee.  Can\'t always find it in our local stores, so I order it thru Amazon every 3 months They have this coffee at where I work... and before this, they had this horrible folgers coffee which HAD to be diluted with sweetner and creamer... I can actually drink this black because it\'s actually good! It tastes like a coffee that was brewed from a cafe, not just your coffee machine at home. Good stuff. This particular type of Yuban coffee is a mild, flavorful coffee that can be enjoyed in the morning or anytime.  It\'s the coffee my mother seems to prefer over all others.  Not always available in stores, I was thrilled when I found it for sale by Amazon! If you like strong coffee, this is it!  The flavor is exceptional, I have not found better in a can.  This can be expensive and difficult to find at your local store.  I have had great luck with Amazon, good price for the subscription order (you can get a case a couple times a year and still get the reduced rate).  Amazon also has a wonderful return policy!&lt;br /&gt;Try Yuban if you love strong coffee and have not found the coffee for you, this may be it!  We have been drinking it for 10+ years now &amp; have had the Original, Organic and Dark Roast---I dont have a preference, they are all excellent. My husband and I recently moved here from Las Vegas to Steeler Nation. We have tried ever coffee on the shelves at all the supermarkets far and wide. We had been drinking Yuban for at least 10 years in Las Vegas. We called the District Manager for Kraft and found out that East Coast people don\'t like it or were not accustomed to it. West of the Mississippi is where you\'ll find it. So we had to order by the case load to satisfy our drinking pleasure. We got the best deal from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon; and it arrived very quickly without paying anything extra in shipping fees.  Time to order it again!! This ground coffee is almost as good as fresh-ground coffee beans.  My husband is a coffee snob and he loves this coffee.  I have to admit the fresh ground is better, but Yuban makes a really good ground coffee.  Don\'t waste your money on Folger\'s or Maxwell House, this is the best ground coffee out there. We just love Yuban coffee and there is not a store where we live that has Yuban for sale.  I was delighted to discover that I could order it at Amazon.com by the case and always keep it in our pantry.  The only thing that could be any better would be that I could get Yuban beans so I could grind it myself as I make a pot of coffee. Yuban has been my coffee of choice for 20 years. The price at Amazon is very good. I recommend this product for any coffee lover. I can no longer find Yuban on the Grocery shelfs.It is by far the best coffee Delicious flavor and no acid I would highly recommend Yuban A 25% price increase since the end of November, from $37.28 to $46.65. Is it still a bargain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we\'ve passed the $50 mark, which comes out to $5.57 per pound. I pay $5-6 per pound for fresh-roasted beans in five-pound lots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the rating were just for the price, I would make it three stars. Very good product, will purchase over and over again. A convenient way to purchase. I\'ve read the reviews and I agree that Yuban is absolutely the best coffee but at $100 for 12 cans comes to over $8 a can.  That\'s $3 more a can than I pay at my local store.  I don\'t understand the high price? I have never tasted this coffee.  But when people brew it in my house, it makes my house smell like farts.  It might taste really good, but I can\'t get over the fart smell.  You\'ve been warned. The jar is much smaller than I imagined via pictures - I thought it was going to be the size of a mason jar, but it was instead much smaller. It is spicy though! Lots of jalapeno, not a lot of honey mustard! My friend at work and I both eat sunflower seeds quite frequently. We always try new types when we find them. He came back from out-of-town with these a few weeks ago, and we\'re both hooked. They are definitely the best sunflower seeds either of us has had. Not only is the flavor fantastic, but the seeds themselves are top notch. First, they\'re HUGE. Second, there are surprisingly few broken or empty shells. Third, as of yet I\'ve never had a mushy, foul-tasting seed. Sadly, we can\'t find anywhere around us that sells them, so I\'m glad Amazon does. I\'m really looking forward to trying the other flavors from this company as well. He brought more back from out-of-town today...I\'m eating them now, and that is what prompted me to look online for a place to order from. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LDOMT6"&gt;Salt &amp; Pepper Flavored GIANTS Sunflower Seeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found these seeds in a local store only to fall in love with them and then find the store no longer supplied them. I am so glad they can be purchased at Amazon. WARNING!!! They will ruin your desire for any other kind of sunflower seeds! GREAT! These sunflowers seeds are of a great quality in every bag and the flavor of the Salt &amp; Pepper is very bold.  I love these and the shipping service from the company has been great every time I have ordered. I have ordered this product twice now and the service and product have been great.  Would order again !!!&lt;br /&gt;Price of product was comparable to others. Thank you.... These Piquillos are packaged in a thin plastic package, though I thought from the picture that they were packed in a roll-top tin (like sardines are packed in).The peppers that survived the shipping were very good, lightly roasted and with good tangy flavor. However, one of the packages was damaged in shipment and leaked red oil all over the rest of the packs, making a huge mess. Bought these at a local store due to the great ingredients with none of the bad chemicals, and have been waiting for them to be in stock here. I\'ll definitely buy more when they are available, as they are the best shortbread cookies I\'ve ever had, my son agrees, and I love that they\'re basically as good as you could get if you made them yourself, with ingredients you can pronounce and won\'t kill you. :)  SO delicious!!! I gave these packs out as Christmas goodies, but saved myself one.  Delicious!  The gifts were well received also. The picture and description was Pure Butter Mini Shortbread Round, then I decided to order it because I love them so bad. But when i got the package, it came out at Mini CHOCOLATE CHIP shortbread which I don\'t like. I started getting this Folger\'s Half Caff coffee from Amazon because our small town stores don\'t always have it.  It comes in one pound vacuum sealed packs so it stays super fresh and it just fills my canister with one bag.  I like not having to get rid of all those plastic cans and I have it automatically sent to the door so I don\'t have to deal with those last minute trips to the store and find they are out. What a boon for rural, small town people like me. I love this coffee!!  I had always mixed my decaf and regular to get 1/2 caffeine and now I can just buy it!!  Perfect amount for me. I enjoy the flavor of coffee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These vacuum sucked packages make it easy to store and use. It keeps the coffee fresh!!  I use then to refill another container and it works well for me!! This is a terrific deal for a coffee lover that needs to cut back on his/her caffeine consumption.  Great tasting coffee and great deal.  Can spend over $5 for it at the grocery store.  I get mine by the subscription plan for a little over $4 plus no tax. When Habanero is in powder form it doesn\'t taste the same nor does it have the same heat. It\'s almost physically impossible to get a Habanero powder to taste decent. Go with Habanero flakes instead. They taste better and pack a lot more heat. Oh boy, These are a winner at my house.  We used to buy them locally, but they are no longer carried.  :(&lt;br /&gt;My husband found these after trying other brands and these are the ones.  My son loves them as well.  They were delivered quickly and were fresh.  They said they almost had a pop to them.  We will definitely order these again.  They are heavy, so shipping was a little high, although we hope they will come back to W. I love Wasa Crisp \'n Light crackers! As their name suggests, they do have a very light and crisp texture.  They are still strong enough to support hummus or other spreads you may like to use.  However, they are also very delicious by themselves.  Sometimes you just want something to crunch without wasting a lot of calories on chips or other fattening foods, and a stick of celery isn\'t what you had in mind.  I keep these in the pantry all the time. They are low sodium and contain just 20 calories per cracker. These are very healthy 7 grains and very light and crispy, perfect with dips or salsa.  Tastes just like rice cake.  They are very easy on the teeth too, for those who have dental work that they don\'t want to chip. Hard to find in supermarkets. We are trying to curb our carbohydrates.  The Wasa Crisp\'n Light is a big help.  Especially when you need something crisp.  We have and will continue to order this product.  Thanks Amazon for selling this tasty cracker. Hubby and I both have teeth that can\'t handle anything too seedy or hard. I also lost 81 lbs (so far) doing a lower carb diet (not LOW, but LOWER). I pretty much skip bread these days--and cereal, etc--but I don\'t mind using up some of my starch/carb calories on these. So versatile. To dip. To make cracker sandwiches. To use breakfast type spreads on (when a craving for bagels/toast hits). I love them with hummus, with cheese, cracked over soup, topped with egg salad, with neufchatel and sugar-free preserves (I use Nature\'s Hollow). They are so nice to have with my breakfast omelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my super picky hubby likes them. We both adore the texture. Oh, man. How perfect. The lightness that preserves a nice, gentle crispness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasa, please don\'t ever stop making these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this one and the mild rye. Both are now staples here. Satisfy my bread needs without a ton of carbs. And since I restrict myself to 1200 calories, two of these do little damage to my eating plan at 20 calories each. I also like to watch my sodium (middle-aged and almost off blood pressure meds), and these don\'t pack on the salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if they could make one that\'s like an everything bagel--an everything crispbread light and crispy version with the onion/garlic/sesame seed/poppyseed. How cool would that be? (Or maybe they already have, dunno.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I don\'t eat gluten anymore, so I don\'t buy this product these days. For those who don\'t care about grains/gluten, I can still recommend it based on texture/taste/calories. But not for me as I\'m trying to stay gluten-free. Be well... I love the light texture and the taste kind of reminds me of chex cereal which is a good thing. It makes a great snack, I use Laughing Cow cheese wedges spread it on and lay down some spinach or radishes with smoked sardines or tuna. Delicious! Or instead of using a crostini to make bruschetta, I use these crackers. And if I\'m too lazy to make stuff, I just snack on it by itself. The title just about says it all.  These crackers (crispbread, if you will) are light and airy and come in around 4 grams of carb each.  I cut them into 8 pieces with a sharp knife and use them for dips, as well as "conveyers" for cheese and other goodies.  They have become my favourite snack.  Yes, they are bland, but I like the fact they pick up the flavour of what they are served with and don\'t overpower. These crackers are very delicious, have a wonderful texture, adapt well to any spread, and they are only 20 calories each--great for people watching their calories.  They are very satisfying, and they contain whole grains in a tasty form. I really do love these crackers. They are crisp, tasty and low in calories. I have been eating them with a small bit of mayo and potted meat in the morning with my cappuccino. They have helped me lose weight. Regardless of that fact, I just like the taste. Both my wife and I have been using this product for well over a year. We love it! It is one of seven or eight varieties made by this producer. Recently, each of the other flavors have been available at our local markets, but, for some reason, these markets have been unable to obtain this flavor. I was excited to find it on Amazon.com, and obtain a generous supply with no hassle, and with convenient shipping direct to my home. Comparable products don\'t seem to have the same flavor or consistency, and this one, mixes well with any number of cheeses and/or jellies/jams at snack time. These crackers are certainly Crisp and Light. I am a low-carb eater and am happy to have something crunchy to munch on while watching my carbs (4 net carbs per cracker for Atkin\'s followers). If you are used to buying different flavors in the grocery store, the ones that come in the kind of flimsy paper wrapping, these actually arrived in a more sturdy cardboard box. For the people complaining about bland taste, I think the point is to put stuff on them not necessarily eat them as is. I like that they have a very mild flavor so as not to overpower what you put on them, you can top with something savory or sweet. My favorite toppings are cream cheese, ham and cheese, chicken salad or sugar-free preserves (they are sturdy enough to stand up to spreading cold cream cheese on them). I buy these at a local grocery store, not from amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are absolutely lovely. Light and crisp, they\'re like naked Cheetos, that are actually fairly healthy. They can be topped with most anything, sweet or savory. Great for midnight snacks, afternoon snacks, or crumbled up in tomato soup at lunch or dinner. Wish they\'d make them in flavors, they\'d beat the pants off most "diet" snacks I\'ve ever seen! While visiting my daughter in Seattle, WA she introduced me to these wonderful Wasa wafers (alliteration intentional).  I really like them and they are an ideal substitute for bread.  I couldn\'t find this product in the stores around Fresno, CA.  I decided to give Amazon a try and sure enough, they came through.  I subscribed to have shipments sent to my home quarterly and again Amazon came through.  You AMAZE me!&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUJLHE"&gt;Wasa Crisp \'n Light 7 Grain, 4.9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)&lt;/a&gt; My daughter absolutely loves this stuff and she is a very picky eater.  It is also hard to find in the supermarket. I bought these one time at my local Safeway and absolutely loved them.  I dipped them in a creamy cucumber dressing and the combination was awesome.  Next time I went to buy a box... gone, not even a spot on the shelf where they might have been sold out.  This happens to me frequently -  I find a product and really like it and then the next time I go to purchase it, it\'s gone.  I looked for these Crisp \'n Lights at all our large grocers and other stores like Target and Rite Aid.  No luck.  Fortunately, I picked up a case here on Amazon and will covet every box. I love these so much I\'d give them a 10-star.  I love them so much I have an Amazon subscription so they get mailed to me regularly.  I discovered them at Henry\'s but they\'re the only cracker on the shelf that are always sold out so when I saw the 10 pack here I was so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eat them as a bread substitute with everything!  Can\'t go wrong with the calories and they don\'t have a strong flavor to mask the food so really they can be eaten however way you like.  Endless possibilities ... Wasa has a great line of \'crackers\', but these have become my favorite. They are light but not wimpy. Their flavor is fairly neutral so they don\'t conflict with whatever you choose to put on them. And for me, the calorie count was the final winner...only 20 calories per cracker and low sodium. A winner all the way around and Amazon has the absolute best price! these crackers are perfect...you know why?&lt;br /&gt;because they have a subtle light flavour that doesn\'t overpower whatever you\'re eating on top of them...whether it be guacamole, hummus, or mustard and cheese...  :) We love these crackers for our salmon spread.  They have just the right flavor and crispness to enjoy the taste of the spread.  And they\'re healthy! This Crackers are so good. They have very little calories, very little fat and still they are crunchy and creamy. I\'m on a diet right now and these really help me on my craving moments. Depending on my caving I can eat them plain or with turkey or a spread. My kids and their friends love them too and eat them with cream cheese which makes a very healthy snack. Buying them on Amazon was a great idea because they cost less, they are fresher than in stores and I don\'t even have to go to the store to get them. I bought Wasa Crisp\'n light crackers at my local supermarket yesterday because they were out of the Wasa rye crackers I usually by - that I really like. This was the last box and I am so happy I bought it!  I love these!  I enjoy most of the crackers by this company, but this is now my absolute favorite and I plan on buying it through Amazon because it is cheaper, I can save time and gas physically shopping and the convenience (Amazon has great customer svc.) is what I appreciate!  By the way, I enjoy these crackers plain and I\'ve eaten them with salmon cooked lightly in olive oil and capers and it was superb! We love this crisp bread because it\'s made from 7 whole grains, does not contain any corn syrup and stays fresh for weeks after being opened. It\'s soft yet crunchy and tastes great. Can only recommend and will definetly buy again. Since I am counting calories I find Wasa crisp\'n light very tasty. You can eat three of them and feel like you are eating a lot more than you really are. I think the taste is great and have told all my friends about them. once I tried these I was hooked. good healthy food that tastes good alone or with tuna or seafood salad. light crispy and melts in your mouth. Great low-carb alternative, they arrived fresh, and unbroken, I\'m satisfied with Amazon and with purchase again. As a person who has metabolic syndrome (and my roommate has insulin resistance), we both always have to watch our carb intake.  Giving up foods such as pasta, potatoes and most breads has been a very difficult, but also a very necessary part of my life over the past several years.  I\'ve tried lots of other low-carb crackers (including other Wasa crackers), but they\'ve just been so-so.  About six months ago, I picked up a Wasa Crisp \'n Light cracker for the first time and WOW, what a taste!  Spread a little bit of Earth Balance on it, or some low-fat cheese and it\'s absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  I\'m so glad that I can get a case every three months through my Amazon subscription. When I was diagnosed with diabetes 5 years ago, I thought I was doomed to a bland diet for life. Not true! Especially, when I found Wasa Crisp &amp; Lights, it solved some of my problem. With a thin coat of "You Won\'t Believe It\'s Not Butter" and thin slices of banana, I have a desert or tasty snack; without the banana, I can just eat them as bread, and they are so light and thin with the spread; they are so tasty, and I don\'t feel guilty after eating them. I can put cooked or raw tomato on them, with a dash of sage &amp; basil to add to the flavor. I have successfully kept my blood sugar normal consistently with diet control. I am not doomed to a bland diet, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUJLHE"&gt;Wasa Crisp \'n Light 7 Grain, 4.9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)&lt;/a&gt; These little gems are only 20 calories each and almost fat free, and taste way better than a rice cake, IMHO.  I\'m glad they come in packs of 10 boxes because otherwise the husband and kids would eat them all and there\'d be none left for me! I love these crackers.  They\'re perfect when you want the light crunchy snack without the calories of other crackers.  They\'re good topped with lox or cinammon and sugar. It\'s hard to put a *star rating on this.  I like the crackers a whole lot and think they are super.  They are hard to find in our local stores and I use Amazon a lot for good pricing and hard to locate items.  However, this purchase experience was a little disappointing.  The crackers came quickly and in great shape...no breakage and the price was fine.  But, when I opened the first box, I found they had weevils...not a huge infestation but still...once weevils get a foothold, it\'s all over but the shouting.  I suspect that these boxes have been stored in a southern location as we don\'t have weevils up here in the north.  Usually they come up in flour and flour products that originate down south.  I found them in southern biscuit flour that I bought at one of the discount grocery stores.  I pop the product in the freezer to kill the weevils and their eggs and then sieve them out...gross, but you can\'t save money if you toss everything that doesn\'t meet your approval.  Anyway, can\'t sieve crackers but I\'m still tossing them into the freezer for good measure.  Don\'t want them to spread to any of my other pantry items.  This review is just a heads up to anyone buying these on Amazon.  Inspect them carefully, pop them in the freezer if in doubt, and enjoy.  The crackers get a 5-star rating; the purchase on Amazon gets a 3 star for warehouse storage. I love these light, airy crackers. Three of them are only 60 calories-on WW, just 1 pt! Spread with reduced fat peanut butter, just 3 pts. A light part of a light lunch! I used to buy them at the supermarket, but they don\'t always have them. When I found them on Amazon, I was thrilled! And using the automatic reorder feature, saved me 15% and no cost shipping! Woo-hoo!. Might I add, you can change the frequency of that at any time. I have a tried a few of these Wasa crisp breads.  This one was by far the worst.  It was in essence entirely flavorless.  It tasted to me the way that I expect that those little packing Styrofoam peanuts would taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\'t get me wrong it didn\'t taste bad, hence the 2 stars, it just didn\'t taste like anything.  Looking for a low-cal snack type cracker?  Try the Wasa Sourdough Rye crackers.  Now those are heavenly! WASA Crisp\'n Light inside packaging cannot be recycled.  The crackerbread is excellent, but its inside packaging is a cellophane or type of plastic that cannot be recycled anywhere in the six states I have contacted.  Todate WASA has not revealed what the inside packaging is made of, nor where I can recycle it. I think these are a bit boring (I like my cooked peas at least salty and preferably spice-enabled) but they do undeniably taste like peas, and my toddler begs for them ("peas! peas!"). I suspect she likes the crunchiness. I bought a single package to try them out and bought the multi-pack today. I think they\'d probably be good in homemade trail mix, too. I order these peas and they came fast. the product&lt;br /&gt;has a good flavor and I am very happy with the peas.&lt;br /&gt;I will order with them again Great snack and good on salads.  It\'s dried peas, what else can I say? I bought Crunchies Freeze-Dried Organic Peas and some other Crunchies products in hopes they would be a satisfying, healthy snack for my children.  Both of my kids (ages 5 and 8) gave me the thumbs down on taste, though.  Same reaction to the other dried veggies and even the dried fruits. So, my desk at work is now full of Crunchies products, and they are a nice quick snack to keep me going between meals. I recommend them for this purpose, but I think most kids will probably say no to these products given the flavor of the snacks is OK, not great. Just wanted to compliment this company on their great, prompt service and the freshness of the cookies.. Bought them to give as a gift, and when i brought them home my kids ate them lol. I would recommend these cookies to anyone and everyone.. This is absolutely the best sauce for making Carolina BarB Q. I,ve looked for a long time and am glad that I finally found the best. I have been using this Peppered Gravy Mix for years. I found it at a Wonder Bread discount store at least 15 years ago. It is the best you could ever make. I always made from scratch, but I believe this is even better. Unless I tell them, no one knows it wasn\'t made from scratch. So easy, and can use it for pork sausage, chicken, even ground beef. If you haven\'t tried it, you don\'t know what you are missing. Good price, best taste. This mix makes a gravy that taste like your good ole southern grandmother made the gravy. No more lumps and everyone thinks you made it from scratch. If you are thinking about it you have to try this. It is the best thing since the invetion of peanut butter This gravy is great!  1/4 cup has only 50 calories and 6 grams of carbs, which has helped my husband loose over 20 pounds.  How?  Well the low carbs helped, but the main feature that makes low-cal/low-carbs part of the formula work, is the great taste.  This gravy has got a peppery tang that makes it just right for spicing up eggs or chicken or anything else you might through a white pepper gravy over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I don\'t know if you have tried other packaged sauces, but I have, and generally they aren\'t very good even when freshly made.  Worse, these sauces tend to get \'strange\' in the fridge overnight.  (Oddly watery, or jell-like... yuck)  This S&amp;M Gravy mix doesn\'t do that, which means that it\'s good for several meals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for the gravy-challenged.  My southern reared husband is a content... and thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam T~&lt;br /&gt;mom, reviewer at large, and wife to gravy lover My wife always made her own gravy from scratch and is good at it. However, this gravy is fantastic, idiot proof (even I can make it) and reminds me of my grandma\'s cooking. My wife loves it and this will definitely be a new staple for our cupboard. My wife use to make homemade peppered gravy which would take a long time to make and a big mess also.  When we discovered this pepper gravy, we decided that there was no need for the time and mess to make homemade as this was as close as you can get to homemade and again without all the time and mess.  As indicated by others, the addition of other ingredients such as sausage is also quite simple.  We would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys peppered gravy. Forever for the perfect easy peasy gravy mix.  This is my fave!  Tastes just like the restaurant ones I love so much;  Like Bob Evans, and IHOP. This is a very delicious gravey mix. I add a pound or so of browned, drained breakfast sausage after it is heated and serve over bisquits. It is super fast and easy. I serve with cut up fresh fruit and there you have a simple, quick breakfast or brunch meal! I would highly recommend. We were looking for a tasty, spicey gravey mix.  When searching the internet we saw this item and&lt;br /&gt;decided to try it.  What a lucky find.  It is all we anticipated and more, being easy to prepare as well&lt;br /&gt;as tasty and spicey.  Now we need look no further.  When we run out we know where to go to order&lt;br /&gt;it. The gravey is wonderful.  It taste just as good and the one from Scratch.  Except it is not as greasy We love this stuff!!! I use it in my heat and eat breakfasts I make in advance so I don\'t have to cook every morning. My wife uses it for all kinds of recipes including just as really good gravy. We used to buy it all the time in California but it\'s not sold locally so we have to mail order it. MUCH less expensive from Amazon even over the manufacturer. For us the larger 4.5 Oz size is much more economical than the 2.5 Oz. Very good taste and a good price, no sales tax, no shipping charges and delivered to my door This is by far the best Peppered Country Gravy mix you can buy!  I have tried them all(almost).  It is also very diverse in what you can do with it..  Add sausage for sausage gravy, chicken broth and chicken for an awesome creamy chicken gravy.  Same with turkey, ham, etc..  Nothing compares to SM\'s mixes, unless you make it from scratch and are good at it. Absolutely amazing! This gravy wins over any other hands down for that good ole down home country taste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My neighbor &amp; I frequently eat meals together. Yesterday I slow-cooked pork chops in about 3 cups of water, with diced potatoes, onion, pepper, frozen speckled butter beans, &amp; parsley, sage &amp; a can of cream of chicken soup for seasoning. She made mashed potatoes &amp; after removing the pork chops, added a pack of this gravy mix to the sauce right in with the beans &amp; diced potatoes for a lovely rich gravy. I don\'t recall a meal like it since my grandmother\'s house! We saved the leftover gravy, and tonight we\'re cooking chicken &amp; corn to serve with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have this saved so we can keep ourselves in gravy heaven! Thank you Amazon.com for carrying this &amp; Southeastern Mills for a quality, reasonably priced, fantastic gravy! The Southern Mills gravy is  a very satisfying gravy for an easy fast topping for either bisquits or hashbrown potatoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mix is easy to use and there are never any left overs. It hits the table and it is gone.... everyone seems to love it. I\'m a huge fan of the McCormick brand gravy mix and I assumed that this would be as good.  It isn\'t.  It\'s not bad enough for a 2 but i\'m annoyed that i convinced myself to buy a case of this stuff instead of the McCormick. This is such a nice change from ordinary ketchup. More pizzaz! I\'ve been putting it on everything...... it\'s great on eggs and hash browns. I\'m glad I bought 6 bottles. Shared some, and am going through the rest pretty fast. It\'s hard to find locally. Our local grocery stores no longer carry Tobasco Ketchup, so went out to the internet and found it on Amazon.  I don\'t use ketchup all the time for everything, but when I do, I like it spicy.  Good stuff.  I don\'t know why our local grocers do not carry it any more.  This seller delivered the product in a timely manner as well. This was my first experience of a bad Darjeeling - before, I hadn\'t known there was such a thing. The first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive-green. The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking I\'d brewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson\'s Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the price, I knew I was gamboling and consider this a lost bet. I have given the product two stars instead of one, because I haven\'t thrown it out (yet). I keep a supply of Lipton\'s bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment, and I don\'t really need more emergency tea. Perhaps it will work for iced tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By no means am I an expert, but I do value tea, and so I hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two Darjeelings. Davidson\'s ships quickly with value pricing, and so I am not giving up on the merchant. Just on this particular Darjeeling. I bought two kinds of Davidson\'s bulk teas, Darjeeling and Gunpowder Green, and I was very disappointed in the quality. They both make kind of a murky harsh tea. The Darjeeling is very light in color and has an aftertaste more like pekoe. The Gunpowder Green is weak and flat. I certainly wouldn\'t recommend them. Really good quality tea.  Much superior to Twinings as tea.  The releasable plastic lined paper bag is much superior to the tins to keep excess air out.  This is important so the tea won\'t oxidize.  The tins look nice, but they hold too much air and don\'t reseal like a plastic zip seal. Tastes like darjeeling, although, like one of the previous reviewers said, it\'s missing some of the body of a good darjeeling. I give it 3 stars for taste alone. But for the price I paid for it, I guess it\'s still a solid deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for and for the cost of this tea, I guess it\'s good. :) Beautiful clear reddish in the cup and delicious with no off taste or "bite".  Recommended without hesitation.  Just opened the bag, and I\'m ordering some more already. The price is right. Organic Tea at a great price, but that\'s as far as it goes. I\'ve tried about 5 of the Davidsons so far and they just lack character. I have never received anything like this from amazon before. The product was packed in an old used golf ball box(bizarre). The cans were all dented and old looking. The bowls were chipped up. I thought, oh well, maybe the soup will taste good. Wrong!Three different flavors but they were all awful, completely inedible. All of them were horribly fishy and metallic tasting, the worst canned soups I have ever tasted in my life. Poured them all out and donated the chipped bowls to charity. Complete waste of money. This product is delicious.  I will say this upfront - Thou semi messy (why not place the peanut butter in the center??? Instead on the back?)  The taste is great.  So great that I started to eat them all day -- not good as it ruins the enjoyment!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are actually so good I had to stop eating them!!! (I guess I over did it!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value:  Excellent snack for everyone (all my friends love them) / family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping:  Fast (as always with Amazon Prime membership - 2 days)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:  6 Boxes Total - each contains 6 individually wrapped granola "thins"  (1/3 of granola bar but flat with peanut butter on one side [seriously).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also do not ruin the granola as I did by eating every day!!! Also I notice to avoid mess just open with scissors!!! (pealing makes a mess!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]  Exclusively Perfect mid morning snack for someone like me who is currently doing a meal replacement drink for breakfast. One of these and piece of fruit is just what you need to get you to through to lunch. HAVE TO SAY I USED TO EAT THE NATURE VALLEY PEANUT SWEET AND SALTY BARS,THEN WHEN THESE GRANOLA THINS CAME OUT AND I TRIED THEM,I JUST CAN\'T STOP EATING THEM. THE PEANUT BUTTER FAVOR IS MY FAV.TRIED THE DARK CHOCOLATE AND WASN\'T TOO IMPRESSED BUT I SWEAR I COULD EAT A WHOLE BOX IN ONE DAY OF THE PEANUT BUTTER FLAVOR IF I LET MYSELF.I HAVE READ OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT THEM BEING MESSY AND THEY ARE A LITTLE BUT THAT DOESN\'T STOP ME FROM ENJOYING THEM.THEY ARE A LITTLE CRUMBLY AND THE PEANUT BUTTER STICKS TO YOUR FINGERS A LITTLE BUT WHO CARES.THE PEOPLE WHO SAID THE PEANUT BUTTER STUCK TO THE WRAPPER MUST BE STORING THEM IN VERY HOT ENVIRONMENTS.I HAVE NOT HAD THIS PROBLEM AT ALL! LOVE,LOVE,LOVE THEM!!!  TRY THEM YOU WON\'T REGRET IT. As a Registered Nurse who is also diabetic, I especially like the convenience of the Nature Valley Granola Thins for a quick pick me up if I experience low blood sugars.  The best part of this product, though, is the taste!  The worst part is that the actual thin is 2-4 bites and gone...all deliciously, though.  They do make a log of crumbs so I suggest eating it over a saucer or napkin, don\'t miss morsel of this incredible product!! These are so good and also healthy for a snack. Only 2 weight watcher point and 90 calories. When I was in Girl Scouts in the 60\'s there was a cookie like this Savannah it was an oatmeal crunchy sandwich cookie filled with peanut butter icing. The first bite I took I was back there. It was so good. I love that they are wrapped one to a pack and not double. I eat one everyday. They range from $2.98 to $3.89 a box in my area so the subscribe and save is the way to go. I tried the dark chocolate and they are also good but the memories the peanut butter ones bring with the flavor are my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you remember those cookies you will love these. If you like peanut butter and a healthy granola taste then hit the add to cart button fast. You will not regret it. YUMMMMMMMMMMY. It\'s been a month or so since I read the other reviews but if I remember, some found them to be a bit messy to eat. I haven\'t had any problems, even when keeping a box on top of the fridge where it tends to get a little warm,, but the piece of plastic coated cardboard that covers the peanut side peeled off cleanly without any peanut butter sticking to it and I had no problems eating the peanut butter coated thin.  Would not recommend taking with you in your purse on a hot day as a snack however as I suspect they would get gooey if at higher than normal temperatures.  I just signed up for 1 month subscription so I won\'t run out...I did run out the first time and I missed them so now I\'ll have enough to last a month.  When I bought the first order, I couldn\'t find them in local stores but haven\'t looked lately since I\'m using Amazon\'s subscription program.  Note that a single packet serving is not much food.  But I\'m trying to control sugar intake and I have not found myself eating more than one at a time.  Maybe because the foil packet isn\'t the easiest to get off (not a problem) and it\'s not like caramel corn or Oreos where I can keep eating so many that I don\'t realize it until the package is empty.  I would recomment. Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- These are definitely tasty -- especially when taken from the freezer!&lt;br /&gt;- Wheat is not one of their ingredients, so they\'re OK for gluten-sensitive but non-allergic people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- They contain (less than 2% of) soy (lecithin) which is a state recognized allergen.&lt;br /&gt;- They contain canola oil which is one of the least healthy oils on the market, devoid of nutrients and chemically processed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May be a con:&lt;br /&gt;- They contain palm oil which unless harvested conscientiously (and more expensively) significantly contributes to the rainforest destruction e.g. in Indonesia. I don\'t know how Nature Valley\'s suppliers harvest their palm oil -- hence the separate "may be a con" category. These are wonderful!  But, they are small, so I usually eat 2 at at time.  And... will melt easily and are hard to get off the paper.  So, I keep them in the fridge.  LOVE THEM!! While the product is delicious, it\'s annoying that the peanut butter stays on the waxy paper instead of on the product. You need a fork to scrape the peanut butter off the protective top sheet. First of all, these things are delicious. However, opening them without making a mess is nearly impossible. They\'re super crumbly, so open the package with care. I won\'t buy them again. There are too many other good options that are way less messy. My first exposure to Patchi choclates was in Abu Dhabi, where Patchi stores are found aplenty. Now that we are back in the States, Amazon is the only place I\'ve been able to find Patchi. Hooray! The chocolates are as rich and delicious as I remember. If you have never enjoyed Patchi chocolates - do yourself a favor and buy some! My husband &amp; I have always bought Lucini vinegar\'s but in todays economy we try to look for a substitution since Lucini is expensive. I hit the jackpot right off with Cherry Republic\'s Sweet Cherry Balsamic. My husband &amp; I use the cherry vinegar straight up on our salad as dressing or on a plate of fresh sliced tomatoes so it can draw out the true flavor. This vinegar is even sweet enough to sprinkle on a bowl of fresh sliced fruit for an extra kick but tart enough to use as basting on your fried chicken or fish. You cant go wrong with this vinegar for the price.....so we say bye-bye Lucini\'s Cherry Balsamic, now to find a great pear vinegar to replace another Lucini type we use: any idea\'s? We have been trying several chilis by small companies via Amazon and this one so far is our favorite.  I added some non-soy meat substitute crumbles and that gave it a very nice texture. Purchased this product at a local store in NY and my kids and i love it. Its a quick easy meal. You can put in a toaster oven on toast for 6 min. and its ready to eat.&lt;br /&gt;strongly recommend I really love this oatmeal, it is such a lovely treat. Quick and easy to prepare and delicious as an ingredient for smoothies and even in flapjacks, a must buy!! I am very excited that I have found this oatmeal.  It tastes great and it is quick to make.  When looking to go gluten free, so many of the books I was reading were offering eggs as a morning breakfast item.  I don\'t like eggs so my life seemed pretty much doomed to Silk milk smoothies.  This is a great breakfast option for me now.  My only gripe is that my grocery store cannot seem to keep it on the shelf so when I see if, I buy a couple of boxes. My 2 GF/DF girls love this instant oatmeal. We have tried MANY MANY brands for a quick breakfast option and this one is by far the best. It is a bit sweeter than old fashion oatmeal, but not overbearing by any means!  Great start to the day! I love oatmeal for breakfast, but it takes so long to prepare it and then sweeten it and add mix-ins that I usually don\'t have time. This instant granola is just about perfect. The only thing wrong with it is that it\'s a bit too sweet. When I don\'t have time to make oatmeal in the morning, I throw one of these packs into my bag and make it when I get to work. It\'s also a great portion manager; it takes the guesswork out of how much oatmeal is in one serving. Yay an all natural Kids Gum .  NO BHT Preservative ! No dangerous artificial sweetners .  Tastes fine and not bad for you ! While beef stew is almost too easy to make, I will admit to not being great at replenishing my seasonings supplies as needed. Because seasonings and spices/herbs are so expensive, I keep putting off purchasing them and the list to replenish them just keeps getting longer and longer. Eventually, I don\'t have anything with which to work. As such, I planned 2 6-qt crock pots of beef stew for over the holidays to always have something hearty and warm on hand for family as they came/went.  Lo and behold, when I finished cutting up all the meat and veggies and loaded them into the crock pots, I had nothing on hand to actually flavor those main ingredients. So, sent hubby off to the grocery store for a quick cheat...McCormick\'s beef stew seasoning packets. Of course I never told him how many to get, and as he wanted to \'do it right the first trip\', he got a handful of them. Actually, in error, he grabbed the ones I\'d never seen before: the "SLOW COOKERS" item. Man, oh, man! To heck with buying expensive, one-jar spices to keep on hand for this meal. This product worked perfectly! Open packet, mix with 1 1/3 Cups water, pour over ingredients in crock pot, mix it up just once and let the cooker rip for a few hours. The stew was excellently cooked, beef was so tender one needed a spoon with which to lift it otherwise it would break apart and the veggies were tender but not mooshy. It was more than flavorful; the au jus was not too thick and not too thin - perfect for sopping up with homemade bread that, unlike my spices, is always available in this house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much, as did the family members, I\'m back to purchase the pack of 12 here to keep on hand as well as the "SLOW COOKERS" for pot roast. I confess, for these two meals from now on, I\'m being lazy, but quick and efficient. No serious measuring, no countless bottles of assorted spices, no mess and a tremendous result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I did use 2 packets for each 6-qt slow cooker for although there is an easy recipe on the reverse of the packet, I don\'t measure my meat and veggies. I use what I have on hand and once the crock pot is at least 3/4 full, that\'s when I usually throw in my seasonings. The recipe provided would not be enough for my family. I didn\'t notice any additional recommendations on the packets indicating how much for what size slow cooker. I began with just one packet dissolved in the recommended 1 1/3 Cups of water (I used boiling water to dissolve it quicker add some warmth to the slow cooker as it begins cooking), but after pouring it over all the meat and veggies in the first pot, I just didn\'t think 1 packet was enough as my family likes a lot of the \'gravy\'.  Therefore, I added an additional prepared packet to each 6-qt crock pot which gave me perfect results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product uses only natural spices, no MSG, 0g trans fat per serving and no artificial flavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 1/2/10 - Another batch made for New Year\'s...this time, I reduced the amount of water per packet to 1 Cup (vs 1 1/3) and got thicker, more substantial \'gravy\' vs  the usual \'au jus\' consistency. The family liked it much, much better that way. My mother and I have been trying to find Ground Celery Seed for some time now.  We have not been able to find it anywhere locally so I decided to purchase this product online.  Hesitant to purchase food items online, I placed my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived well packaged and undamaged.  It was sealed and fresh.  If you are looking for a healthy alternative to Celery salt, try this instead.  You do not get the salty flavor and a more robust Celery flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish McCormick would package this in a smaller container again. I\'ve been looking for ground celery seed for at least 2 years.  It used to be always be avaialbe at grocery stores with the rest of the spices, but for some reason stopped being there.  Regular celery seed is easy to find, but not the ground version.  So, I found online.  I wanted McCormick (or some familiar brand).  I\'m very satisfied with what I ordered - it\'s very good and fresh.  My only complaint is that I couldn\'t purchase a smaller quantity than two large 16 oz containers.  I don\'t use that much, so gave away the one container to a friend, and it will take me years to use 16 oz container that I kept!  :)  But, happy to now have found.  Hope for others that McCormick decides to package in smaller quantities. I\'ve tried a number of high-quality canned cat foods to supplement the dry food my cats always have available to them, and these appear to be the best as judged by me and the cats.  For one thing, these actually look like fish.  You open the can, and there are large pieces of actual fish in the can, instead of the weird, mystery paste.  It pretty much smells like you\'ve opened a can of real fish, too (not in a bad way, though I don\'t share my cats\' love of sardines.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my two cats is a picky eater when it comes to canned food.  I picked up a can of each of the varieties from the local pet store when I wanted to try switching to Tiki Cat, and learned that the picky one will only eat the varieties that include sardines.  There are a few different sardine varieties, so at least it forces her to have some variety in her diet in case they stop producing one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picky one has always been very excited about getting her daily quota of canned food, but the other cat seems way more excited about dinner time since we switched to Tiki Cat, so I take that as her endorsement of this positive review. This food is so full of chunks that my cats just love.  They are normally on a variety of top quality pate foods, but I wanted to give them something to chew on and would take them longer than a few minutes to eat.  This is stuff kitty dreams must be made of for sure.  It is for both of mine anyway. My two feline food critics just love these sardines, and I love being able to give them these sardines. Each tiny can is stuffed with great big chunks of sardine, and my cats are in heaven when they get this for dinner. This is super high quality cat food, a huge treat for any pampered pussycat out there who likes fish. It makes a very nice change from all the tuna based foods out there, and I try to always have some on hand so I can vary my cats\' diet. It\'s all natural real food that you can see the difference. My cat loves it so much that now we call him the tiki kitty. The cats love it. I could live without the smell and seeing the pieces of cut up fish in it but the cats love it.Wish I would have purchased more the price was right and it is good quality food for them. My finicky calico just LOVES this food.  One of the few wet foods she will actually eat. It is loved by our other three cats as well.  Will definitely be buying this again. My cat Tigger eats this stuff up fast. Then he asks for more so I figure it must be good. This is not your typical cat food! My cat loved this food for a long time. However, he has been picky lately. It\'s been harder and harder to get him to eat this, but the variety offered in this cat food is good and seemed to keep my cat healthy! My cats are not picky eaters, and lick their bowls clean of virtually anything i feed them (wellness, fussie cat, fancy feast, bff). I tried feeding them Tiki Cat on 2 separate occasions, and my cats threw up both times. I thought they may have gotten sick the first time from eating something off the floor, but when it happened a second time I was certain it was the Tiki Cat. I\'m not sure if I received a bad batch, but I will certainly never be purchasing a Tiki Cat product again. I tried Tiki Cat Variety Pack and the only one my cats really ate well was the Bora Bora Sardine Cutlets in Lobster Consomme. Maybe one other flavor, I think the one with crab, they sorta ate, but definitely this one. So, I ordered a couple packs of 12 small cans. I feed them 1 can per day along with their dry food. They also like Weruva canned cat food and a new one called Addiction canned cat food which so far they love all the flavors I got them. My one skinny cat is super crazy over the Lobster Consomme part, but both cats eat it all. Nutritionally, sardines are really high in RNA which is a building block and RNA also contains the sugar ribose. She liked the food a little at first but didn\'t want much to do with it... The price is very high and not worth it if she\'ll only eat a couple of bites. She had tried most of the flavors and would always have the same reaction. I first learned bout Tiki Cat while searching for responsible and healthy food for my cats. I tried many different brands of cat food before Tiki Cat. I knew I had a hit when even my finiky cat came running for Tiki Cat food time. They seem to like the Sardines best, but I\'m sure that every cat is different, and Tiki Cat has so many varities you\'re sure to find one your cat likes. Amazon has the cheapest price for this product, and it\'s delivered right to my door! I\'ll never have to drive to a pet store and pay extravagent prices for good cat food again! The Oriental Flavor Ramen Noodles taste okay but I almost always add ingredients to make the dish more wholesome. I prepare it by adding sesame seed oil, vegetables and water then adding the seasoning and noodles after the water boils. Rough vegetables like chopped onions taste better if they are boiled with the seasoning for 15 minutes prior to adding the noodles. Tried this in a turkey burger and it was sooo good. I definitely recommend faery free. Salt can be added or better yet add a sprinkle of Goya Adobo. extremely good deal. i placed the order on tuesday, got the package on saturday. the packaging is very good (vanilla beans are vacuum packed as well as comes with a heavy ziploc bag for after you open the vacuum pack). 1/2 vanilla bean is about a little over 50 vanilla beans. every grocery store i go (wegmans, whole foods, weiss etc etc) that carries vanilla beans usually only sells them in packets of 2 vanilla beans for typically $12. so if you buy 50 vanilla beans 2 at a time for $12 each, thats $300! so basically you\'re saving $272.31. I am a professional chef and specialize mostly in pastry, cakes, and desserts. It plays hell with my diabetes but I just love creating some delicious dessert for friends when we have small gatherings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy vanilla beans in Tijuana, Mexico because I can get good quality at a decent price. By that I mean the beans tend to be supple, shiny, and aromatic. By "decent price" I mean it usually costs me around $1.50 to $2.00 per piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this half-pound package at such a low price I was skeptical but I figured the $25 would not be a big risk and if they were bad I can always return them. I ordered on Jan 11 and got them Jan 13. Free two-day shipping being another great feature of my Amazon Prime membership which I now believe is an excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beans are very high quality. They are "Gourmet Bourbon" which means about 30% moisture (a good thing) and they are shiny and nicely oily (you want the oily surface as that is one part where a lot of flavor is located. The other part is in the seeds and that is the reason the bean is split and the seeds scrapped when used).  These beans are very fresh as shown by their flexibility (as beans grow old they dry out and get brittle- still usable but not as good).  They come sealed in a vacuum bag and that is inside a zip bag. Even through the double packaging the scent is very noticeable and complex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a large quantity of beans. If you are not going to use them rapidly I recommend separating into two or three bean lots and vacuum packing those. For optimal shelf-life I keep mine in a wine refrigerator (it gets cool but not cold) where I keep my 20 or 30 pounds of various chocolates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent deal on good quality. I just can\'t figure out how they manage to make a buck on this one! There are a ton of vanilla beans in this package. They are supple and so fragrant, you can smell them without breaking the seal. Truly a fantastic deal. Just received my beans today and wow!  There\'s an amazing amount for the price paid, they smell absolutely fantastic and came vacuum packed so they\'ll keep practically forever. This product smells so bad that I couldn\'t even try to consume it.  It smells sour and rancid and is detectable even before the package was opened.  The seller has a no return policy so I\'m out the $ I spent on this as it will go right into the garbage. I purchased these with the intent to make vanilla extract. The bean arrived in a timely manner, and were in a vacuum sealed plastic bag. They didn\'t smell super \'vanilla-y\' when they arrived, but I can attest that they were soft and pliable-- maybe too pliable and greasy though. Almost immediate of being immersed in it\'s vodka home, the beans left an oily residue on the top of the glass bottles. The grease has not necessarily gotten worse, but it has some type of oily smell that distracts from the richness of the vanilla. Any one else have this problem? I have been making wonderful homemade vanilla with a recipe that I found on line using vanilla beans purchased from Williams Sonoma. I decided to try Spicy World Vanilla Beans rather than the much more expensive vanilla beans from Williams Sonoma.  Two vanilla beans from Williams Sonoma in a pint of vodka resulted in a very dark richly aromatic vanilla after only two months.  I used three Spicy World vanilla beans in a pint of vodka and after two months I had a liquid that looked like weak tea and had the aroma of alcohol.  I added three more beans and waited.  The results were disappointing, so I added three more vanilla beans.  You can still see through the vanilla and it doesn\'t have the aroma of vanilla.  I am completely disappointed with the vanilla beans from Spicy World.  They are totally worthless, a complete waste of money.  I would not recommend them or purchase anything from Spicy World. Vanilla beans have many uses: you can make vanilla sugar, creme brulee, and many other desserts. You can also make vanilla extract. And if you buy these beans, you can do it all at a fraction of the supermarket price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I priced two vanilla beans in a spice bottle at the supermarket. They cost almost $6. This half pound package of beans that comes in a vacuum pack contains at least 50 beans and cost only $25. I am not quite sure what I will do with all of these, but we did make some bottles of vanilla extract for our favorite cooks for Xmas, and I have vanilla sugar in my cupboard now. The fragrance of these beans is marvelous, but I have resealed the package so the beans won\'t dry out. I may even put a few beans on the counter to make it smell like I have been cooking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recipe:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 cheap fifth of vodka&lt;br /&gt;10-12 beans, sliced the long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remove a cook\'s share from the vodka bottle and replace with the beans. close the bottle. Let sit for at least a month in a cool dark cupboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decant some of the vanilla into a smaller bottle when you need a refill. Put another sliced bean in there, and top off the large bottle with more vodka. Use the smaller bottle for your cooking. Make lots of cookies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can keep this up for about a year. I ordered and got this the next day. Planning to make vanilla for Christmas presents [...]). There were 70 beans in my package - THATSALOTTABEANS - I split it with a friend because I don\'t think I know 70 people who love to bake. . . On their own, they smell somewhat like raisins, but in the package, the smell is heavenly. Crossing fingers that the vanilla works out! but at what, 40 cents a bean, I haven\'t lost much and the price is so much better than the grocery store, where I looked at 2 beans for $12. I wanted to give homemade vanilla extract as gifts and was extremely satisfied with these beans. They made very high quality extract and were much cheaper than at local grocery or organic food stores. I was mildly concerned by the size; I only needed 24 beans, and ended up with closer to 50. However, my brother has used the remainder to make delicious vanilla ice cream, creme brulee, tiramisu, custard, vanilla sugar, french toast, etc. I have recommended them to friends and family. I don\'t understand(believe) the ONE negative review posted here. Why are they the only dissatisfied customer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 1/2lb Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla Beans came in 2 days, and the whole box had the wonderful aroma of vanilla even before opening it!&lt;br /&gt;My dark, 8" long, moist pliable beans were vacuum packed and tucked neatly in a sturdy zip bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh the plans I have for these gems!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\'ll be sure to post an update after utilizing my beans! I\'m constantly trying to find vanilla beans at a reasonable price. Often, when I do, they are hard as rocks, dry, and practically unusable.  I was so frustrated at Safeway where one bean was $13(!), dry and hard as a rock. The best I\'ve found was at Trader Joe\'s, where I could get three beans for $10. They were decent...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This price was SO reasonable, that I worried they were not going to be fresh/good/etc. I was wrong. The beans were incredibly fresh and supple. I\'m using them to make vanilla extract and they have worked perfectly. They keep well in the fridge, so I\'m using them in everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great, but there might be too many to use--if that\'s the case, then split them with a friend. Then it becomes one of the best culinary deals ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely wonderful. I will buy these again and again. I\'ve never bought vanilla beans before, but I have seen them in the store - all dry and crusty looking.  These beans are vacuum sealed, and because of that are still moist.  They smelled great.  My whole pantry smelled wonderful after I put them in there, and they made my homemade vanilla bean ice cream the most vanilla-y ice cream I\'ve ever had.  (Even more vanilla-y than Blue Bell!)  When I run out, I\'ll absolutely buy more of these! I just got these, they are moist and gooey and fresh.  I actually got more beans than the approximate ammount.  They came faster than expected.  Great transaction! We were running out of vanilla. I\'d made my own before using vanilla beans and vodka, and the price of these was far cheaper than getting them locally. I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\'m not sure what I was thinking, but half a pound of vanilla beans works out to something like 50 of them. It\'s hard to picture 50 vanilla beans, but this would be a good order to go in halves on with someone. Or quarters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is incredible. It\'s been a couple of months since we originally opened them, and our pantry still smells like vanilla, even though they are wrapped in two ziploc bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the vanilla itself, it is fantastic. If you\'ve never tried vanilla produced yourself, you are absolutely missing out. There is a distinct and definite difference between homemade and what you buy at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor, hit "add to cart" and check out. You\'ll be glad you did. I purchased these vanilla beans to make homemade vanilla.  This is my first vanilla bean purchase ever.  I was very pleased with the quality of these beans.  There were approximately 50 beans, and they were large, very fragrant, and contained lots of "caviar".  I could see the extraction starting to take place shortly after I split and immersed these in my vodka.  I should have some wonderful vanilla extract in 6 months.  Thanks! What an incredible price for this many high-quality vanilla beans!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I split them with a friend of mine and we\'ve both been making our own extract with delicious success.  At first I thought I might not be able to find use for all the beans, but because I LOVE to make my own (vegan) ice cream, I\'m now totally spoiled by these beans.  I grate them into my (non-dairy) milk and simmer it, then let it cool in the fridge overnight, then go about making my ice cream.  I never want plain vanilla ice cream without using fresh beans again, no way!  It\'s too good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What\'s more, have you ever bought beans from the grocery store?  It costs, like, $12 for two or three beans, and the beans are relative garbage.  These aren\'t dry and odorless like the ones from the store.  Instead, they\'re moist, soft, and have that delightful aroma that makes you just want to bake. It is a lot of beans to go through but the flavor and quality is really nice. They are fresh, soft and very fragrant. I use a lot of vanilla bean because my family loves vanilla sauce and baked goods made with the fresh bean. You must seal these very tightly to keep them soft but with care, they will stay nice for months and you can\'t beat the price! One company sells vanilla beans in a jar and you get two or three beans for anywhere up to $6! And the quality isn\'t anywhere near what these are. I will continue to buy this product. I\'ve ordered these before and I am still thrilled with the product. These vanilla beans are so fragrant that you can smell them through the unopened package!  I used them to make my own vanilla extract as Christmas gifts, and they worked great!  Don\'t be fooled by the product photo: they look stiff and dry in the image, but they\'re soft, pliable, and moist with vanilla oil. I was very happy with the quick delivery of this product and how fresh the beans were.  I am looking forward to my homemade vanilla extract once it is done brewing.  I would definitely buy from this seller again. I purchased these beans based on other reviews.  My plan was to make a Premium Vanilla Extract for family members.  I purchased a very expensive Vodka, unusual bottles to fill, and waited for my bean order to arrive.  I wasn\'t happy about the wait.  The beans arrived after the 4th, and I rushed to open the package.  I could not smell the beans as others reported!  Most of the beans were skinny/shriveled, more dry, and a great disappointment.  I Would Not recommend this product.  I will be looking for another source. I received my vanilla beans exactly a month ago today. As soon as I opened the package I LOVED them. They were very moist and I was very pleased at the quality of the beans. I immediately used 18 of the 50+ to make homemade vanilla extract. The beans did not come with storage instructions so I googled it and read that I needed to store them in an airtight container. I\'ve used them a few times over the past month for cooking but I still had over half the package left. Well, when I opened them this evening they were MOLDED. I am so very disappointed that I will be unable to use the rest of my beans. :( If you\'re able to use all 50 as soon as you get them, then I highly recommend these beans. If not, then I would look elsewhere, or order a smaller quantity. Having been a professional cook for over 20 years I try to seek the best ingredients.  I was very pleased with this product.  From the moment you open the box you can smell them and they are still sealed in their bag.  They are very pliable unlike most of the big store ones and the seeds are very moist and easy to remove.  I needed to make a new batch of vanilla sugar and this was the first time I had to put some crackers in with it as the sugar was clumping within a week.  Should make an interesting cracker too.&lt;br /&gt;John This product had pretty good reviews so I thought it would be safe to buy 4 packages, so I did. Boy am I full of regret now. I\'m stuck with 4 packs of these beans and I can\'t return any them. The moment I opened the bag, I should\'ve known. It had a stale sour smell to them. But the optimistic side of me said, these beans look fresh and plump, maybe it won\'t smell like that once I scrape the seeds out. I was wrong. I made two test batches to see if it was the salt I was using to make my vanilla salt but they both have that weird sour, rancid smell. I\'ve made vanilla salt before so I know what it\'s supposed to smell and taste like. Unfortunately, even after a few days, this smell isn\'t going away. I was really looking forward to making jars of vanilla salt to give out as cheap gifts. But now I need to go buy more vanilla beans to replace these which is going to end up costing me. I\'m so disappointed. I haven\'t cooked with these seeds so I don\'t know if the taste and smell transforms with heat or with any other mixed in ingredient. I know for sure though that if you\'re looking to make vanilla extract, vanilla sugar or vanilla salt, I HIGHLY discourage you from buying this product. Got 58 beans in the 1/2 lbs package which is a great value. They are moist so they are super fresh. Great Find. I received my beans quickly and they smelled great!  I used all of them pretty quickly.  I purchased three 1.75 l bottles of vodka and split the beans evenly among them. They were plump and looked great.  I\'m excited to give my homemade vanilla as Christmas gifts. I received these wonderful beans today through Amazon.  I have not opened the vacuum sealed bag yet but the fragrance is divine.  They are about 6-3/4 inches long and plump and soft. It looks like there are maybe 60-70 beans. Arrived very quickly and packaged safely.  They are vacuumed sealed and then put within a thick plastic ziplock bag.  Even with the packaging I could smell the vanilla when I opened my UPS box.  There are so many beans in here, a very great buy for my homemade vanilla extract!! I could smell the vanilla from the box it was packaged in. It was sealed shut, air extracted from the packaging, so plump &amp; moist.  I specifically got this product based on the comments left from a Pastry Chef.  I am extremely happy with my purchase.  I will definitely be back for these again.  I use them in frosting and cake batters - it\'s soooooo good, words cannot describe the freshness you get with a real vanilla bean vs. an extract.  They were very easy to extract the beans from. I highly recommend this seller. It is an incredible value for both quantity and quality of beans. There are probably around 50-60 beans, although I\'m not positive because I have not taken them out of the packaging to count. I have probably used about 8-10 beans and I can barely tell any are gone from the bag. They come double-sealed, and as another reviewer mentioned, you can smell the vanilla even through the original shipping package. I have purchased grocery store vanilla beans, and I have never seen or tasted anything remotely close to the quality of these beans. I will definitely purchase beans from this seller again. I got these 2 weeks ago, for the price i wasnt expecting much, but they are really fresh and fragrant&lt;br /&gt;i\'ve used them to make bavarian cream and creme brulee and they taste great. I got the beans in the prescribed amount of time, and even before I opened the package I knew they were going to be great.  The amazing aroma of the beans was evident and only intensified after I actually opened the packaging.  I bought them explicitly to make my own vanilla extract, and I have to say they are some juicy beans.  I highly recommend them. The beans smell great and you get a lot of them. If you get a 12 pack of jars and you put 2 beans in each jar, you will still have more than half of them left over. Im trying to figure out what else I can do with them before they go bad. Great price.  Wonderful product.  Everything was as described.  Shipped quickly and was priced great as far as I can tell.  I use these to infuse vodka. (slice the beans down their length first).  Wonderful! I was amazed with how fresh these are and there are so many in 1/2 a pound.  My only suggested would be if you have another person that loves them as much as you do you could split the cost and the beans.  I have so many left over beans I\'ve been giving them away to grateful coworkers but what goes around comes around so here\'s to awesome ingredients! Great vanilla beans at a great price.  I recieved about 60 beans in my pack.  They are plump and perfect.  When I\'ve used them all up I will definitely be buying them again!  I almost didn\'t order them because of the reviews talking about the bad smell to them. I\'m glad I didn\'t listen to them.  They smell like all of the other vanilla beans that I\'ve bought. This is the buy of a lifetime.  $25 for about 50 beans instead of $10 for 2!  And the flavor was great.  Made ice cream that everyone raved about.  I vacuum sealed portions for future use to keep them as fresh as possible. I bought these vanilla beans about a month ago to make homemade vanilla extract and also to have on hand since I always seem to have some culinary use for vanilla beans. I was very impressed with the quality. The dried up store bought vanilla beans cannot compare to these. Will be ordering more soon! Recieved Vanilla beans in a nice bundle in a ziploc bag.  The smell was wonderful even through the bag.  My husband and I used the Vanilla beans to make our own Vanilla extract.  The beans were moist and easy to work with.  We were very impressed and would definitely buy the vanilla beans again. Can\'t wait to see how the homemade vanilla extract turns out. I got the wonderful vanilla beans about a month ago. The first thing I did was to make vanilla sugar. Then I put 10 split beans in 3/4 cup mix of rum and brandy. I shake it every other day. Smells wonderful so far.  I\'m going to split a few beans to put on my stevia  which I use every day.  I also sent a pack of Madascar Bourbon vanilla beans to my 78 year old big sister but she "freaked " out.  "What will I do with these?".&lt;br /&gt;So far I find these vanilla beans luxuriously wonderful. Smelly, soft and tasty if you just take a tiny bite in your morning coffee. These are unbelievably fantastic!  I had to share them, I had so many!  simply the BEST! I put the leftover pods in my sugar, smells amazing! These have good flavor. Plenty of other reviews address that. I also like the thick zipper bag they came in. My only real issue with these is that mine grew mold. I\'ve never had vanilla beans do that before. These seemed unusually moist, so maybe that contributed to the issue. It started as a small spot, but grew so that it was on the ends of most of the beans. I finally got them all out, trimmed off the moldy bits, and froze what was left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took 2-3 months for the mold to start, so if you use them quickly maybe that won\'t be a problem. But, I don\'t go through them that fast. I\'ve had beans dry out in the past, but this is the first I\'ve seen of mold. If you don\'t plan to use them within 2 months or so, I recommend keeping them in a fridge, freezer or coming up with some other way to stop the mold before it starts. These beans are trully wonderful and wonderfully priced. Split a few down the length toss in a bottle of Vodka or Rum or some Bourbon for a few days and you have a wonderfull drink. Great for baking , make truly amazing vanilia bean cookies. These will last a long time the way we use them but could not pass up the deal..came sealed and you could still smell the vanilla...stick one or 2 in your favorite vodka and wait a few weeks...we also make our own extract from them. The first thing you notice when you open up your package is the intensely delicious smell of vanilla.  The package is vacuum sealed, but the smell still leaks out.  These beans are a great deal!  I think I got about 28-32 pods in my bag and was able to make good use of them.  They (as previously mentioned) have a wonderful smell and great flavor.  It is really hard to find a better deal out there. These beans are magic. Plump, moist, potent. The aroma was so rich that I could smell the deliciousness even before I opened the double-wrapped, vacuum-packed plastic bag. The best thing, though, is the price for this outstanding quality. Two weeks ago, out of dire necessity, I paid over $8 for a single vanilla bean in my grocery store spice aisle. The bean was fine, but $8? Really? When I saw these I rejoiced. Less than 50 cents a bean! Now that I have them and have had some home-made vanilla ice cream made with them, I can safely say this is the single best value I\'ve ever found on Amazon in all the years I\'ve shopped here. I\'m sorry the one buyer received a bad batch of these. Mine are perfect. I will definitely be buying again. I was very pleased with my recent Vanilla Bean purchase from Spice world. When I opened the box, and not even unsealed the beans themselves, I could smell the fragrance of the bean, and see that they were in very good condition. The have been very moist,easy to work with, and taste wonderful. I can\'t recommend these people too much, and to say I was completely satisfied wouldn\'t do them justice. I like finding a place I can shop from that will meet my demands for taste and quality... I have a new home! well packaged, and alot of beans for the price(50+).  using them to make home made vanilla extract.  wounderfull flavor. will buy again. The beans arrived in good time, moist and supple, no mold, very good flavor.  What else is there to want in regular bourbon vanilla beans?  I was very pleased with this purchase. I couldn\'t be more pleased with my purchase. Vanilla beans are $5 - $9 a piece if you can find them in the store. These work out to about 51 cents a piece and they are fresher and better quality than the $5 ones. They also come vacuum sealed and a zip lock bag is included for storage after opening. Good job! I bought the vanilla beans to make DIY vanilla extract. I do alot of baking and I like to use good vanilla. The recipe requires moist, full vanilla beans and these were wonderful.The vanilla beans came in a vacuum pack that kept them in very good condition, much better than buying them from the spice section of the grocery store where the jar contains 2 to 3 dehydrated beans. And they made great vanilla extract for much less money than buying the \'real\' vanilla at the store. Can\'t be the price!  The beans have a strong aroma and tasted GREAT in creme brulee!  Just be sure to have an air-tight jar and a vacuum sealer isn\'t a bad idea either to keep them as long as possible. I got these beans based on the good reviews and wasn\'t disappointed. I also got 70 beans in my pouch, nice moist and supple pods that will make a gallon of vanilla extract. Great beans for a great price!!! I could smell the vanilla even through the packaging!&lt;br /&gt;There were lots of vanilla beans and they were all in great shape.  I\'m excited to see how my homemade vanilla extract turns out! I\'ve ordered these before and I am still thrilled with the product.  They are fresh, soft and very fragrant.  I use a lot of vanilla bean because my family loves vanilla sauce and baked goods made with the fresh bean.  You must seal these very tightly to keep them soft (I use the seal-a-meal), but with care, they will stay nice for months and you can\'t beat the price!  McCormick sells vanilla beans in a jar and you get two or three beans for anywhere up to $6! And the quality isn\'t anywhere near what these are.  I will continue to buy this product. Cooking with fresh ingredients always makes your dishes taste, and smell, more delicious!  Highly recommend purchasing these vanilla beans, they arrived vacuum packed and ready to use. These beans were amazing for the price.  Plump, moist and delightful smelling. Made 1.5L of extract with them using silver rum for the alcohol. I was very pleased when I got these vanilla beans. They were shipped in a timely manner and arrived vacuumed sealed. There was a mix of some very plump beans and a few that were thin. I was very happy with my purchase! These beans were vacuum sealed, very fresh and supple.  My only problem was that there were so many I had way more than what I needed for a dozen jars of vanilla flavoring that I\'m preparing as Christmas gifts. Highly recommend. I bake quite often and I love to use fresh vanilla beans.  I have purchased beans from a variety of places and these are the best vanilla beans I have ever used, hands-down!!  They were so moist and plump and LOADED with seeds!!  The fragrance and the taste was so amazing!  I used it in a birthday cake and everyone raved about the taste.  I receieved 70 (yes seventy) half-sized beans in my 1/2 pound package...it would have cost me over $220 to purchase that many beans in the store!  I have a food saver so I divided up the package into smaller packages and have them sealed up and stored in a dark pantry.  I will be interested to see how long they keep. Better than expected! Well packaged, moist, fresh and fragrant beans were just what I needed for my recipe. Perfect. Would not hesitate to order this bargain-priced, excellent product again. To purchase this many vanilla beans for the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;I\'ve not split any of them yet, but they look nice and plump&lt;br /&gt;the way a good bean should look. I have them all soaking in&lt;br /&gt;a big jar of vodka to make vanilla. In six months, I should have&lt;br /&gt;some pretty good quality vanilla, and will still be able to use&lt;br /&gt;the vanilla beans for other things. I use these vanilla beans to make my infamous Creamy Vanilla Caramel ice pops, a fan favorite for my small gourmet popsicle business @FrontPorchPops. It\'s tough to find these locally for a reasonable price so I ordered these from Amazon instead as a time-saver. I was dubious about ordering product online (what chef doesn\'t what to taste, touch and smell it before they decide if it\'s worthy of their customers?), but I was pleasantly surprised to receive moist, flavorul vanilla beans that were exactly what I wanted. I just wish they offered this as a subscription so I could have them automatically sent every month. These bean smelled so fresh, they were moist and plump.  I\'m very impressed with the quality of the beans that were shipped to me.  I can\'t wait to use them in all of my baked goods! These beans arrived quickly and were well-packed in a vacuum sealed pouch.  There were LOTS and LOTS of long, supple black vanilla beans.  They smelled great and were very pliable.  I immediatley made some vanilla sugar, which 3 weeks into it, smells wonderful.  I intend to add beans to vodka for extract.  I also added several beans to oil to make a wonderful vanilla oil for salads.  There are so many beans, I will make a few gift budles wrapped in raffia for my family and friends.  The leftovers seem to be keeping quite nicely in my room temp pantry. I just need more ideas for the rest of the beans. I was tired of paying upwards of $12 for two beans at the local store, so I thought that I would give these a try.  i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the beans.  I was expecting the usual dried out lackluster vanilla flavor I have "enjoyed" from the super market spice rack, but these beans are so much better.  I used to live near a natural food store that carried an excellent selection of fresh  spices, unfortunately with the recession they closed down.  These beans rival those that I could purchase there.  They have a robust vanilla flavor that came through very nicely in the ice cream I made.  I was used to doubling up on the beans in the recipe to get the vanilla flavor I wanted, but quickly found out that I didn\'t have to with these beans.  Highly recommended ! Enjoy! True, the beans were huge, moist and plump, with a good mixture of really big fat ones and smaller skinny ones.  However, the most noticeable aroma coming from the bag and the beans is best described as pungent, with a side of sour.  Is that normal?!?  I\'ve only ever used the crappy dried out grocery store version, and was THRILLED when I saw such a good deal on these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can a vanilla bean expert tell me if that odd, unpleasant aroma is what I\'m supposed to be smelling?? I LOVED this . The beans where fresh and the smell heavenly. I most definately would buy this again. The more expensive ones in the supermarket are dry and way over priced. These were very juicy. Loved it!! I like to eat frozen vanilla yogurt but the catch is that I have to make it myself or it doesnt get done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These vanilla beans are amazing if you are really into vanilla.yougurt or icecream I have always liked the oskri bars... but these with the fennel in them are even tastier.  A great gluten free, no cane SUGAR, no cornsyup, treat for those being health conscious.  Also get a little protein to boot!  MMMmmmm MM! I don\'t really like the chunks of cherry and pistachios.  I\'d just rather have the plain dark chocolate.  I think the plain dark is the best dark chocolate sugar free bar available today. I babysit for my good friends\' kids, to give them a \'date night\' every now and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are always in their freezer b/c they know I am a horrible cook. I always thought 3 year olds were picky eaters, but the twin boys beg me to heat up 2nds for them! My daughter loves them. They are easy to heat up and good for the body and earth. It\'s the perfect weekday dinner for us busy mums. And it\'s so clean to eat, that\'s the key. Not as messy as mac n\' cheese. Thanks Peas of Mind to make my life easier. Would have rated no star if available.  Beefeaters® Chicken Liver Freeze Dried Treats for Dogs, are a product of China, and irradiated "for your protection" according to the company\'s hold message.  Called Amazon.com customer service, and requested a full refund with pre-paid returned shipping.  Too bad none of this is in the product description.  Amazon CSR was very helpful, and very cooperative, postage paid shipping label received via email immediately.  Thank you, Amazon.com! Universally popular with all dogs and is the only treat my pets will eat.  Great that it is all natural. The best treats available. Your dogs will go bonkers for these. I buy a tub a month for my little munchkins and they just love it. Good value online. I\'m a profecinal cat trainer and have used several different treats including raw/freezdried raw  home made and comercial treats over the last 10 years. These treats take the cake and run. OMG all cats/ clients cats love these treats. They are the onlything i will ever use for training again. Best cat treat on the market. just dont forget to cut them up in little pieces there to big for your average house cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a finiky cat that dosnt like to eat. well here is your god send. Just crush some up and toss there food in it. Its a garanteed way to get them to start eating again. Dont use a ton since its high in fat. My cats love freeze dried meats.&lt;br /&gt;They absolutely love these treats.&lt;br /&gt;They are the cheapest of all the treats I buy.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is good, too many small pieces though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy freeze dried beef liver as it is too hard on there tummies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only give them a couple of pieces a day but they know what time that is! Anyone see where theses are made? - I am avoiding treats from China because of all the problems lately. and I do not see a country of origin here. My 3 Boston Terriers LOVE these treats!  They are natural, wholesome and soft enough to break into multiple pieces.  We keep a steady supply of them in the house ... I order at least 2 containers at a time since we don\'t want to run out.  Amazon\'s seller -- All Pets -- has the best price around. At an early age my Beagle (yes, a beagle) was picky about eating.  crushing a little freeze dried chicken liver on his food gave him the incentive to eat.  Now it has become part of the routine. I buy chicken livers for my cat. She has now learned to speak English persuasively in order to get these treats.(lol) They are economical and obviously well liked by my cat. My dog absolutely loved these, and he would have given them a 10 rating if he could.  Unfortunately he is nolonger with us, but he thought they were great for years, and this was the best price I ever found.  Very prompt shipping, and adequate packing My pugs are picky eaters and only like the chicken liver which is hard to find.  This is a great deal. It came promptly, dog is very happy.  For some reason, this batch has much smaller pieces than those that we have ordered in the past.  I guess the dog thinks that is better he gets more treats at one time (even though the amout is about the same). I picked a can of this up on a whim at Big Lots for $1.30 and it is SO easy. I used one of those graham cracker pie shells, opened a can of this filling, and put it in the fridge. In four hours I added some lime zest and whipped cream...my friends did not believe how good it was for coming out of a can! I went back the next day and bought what they had left on the shelf. Highly recommended!! One star given just for possibility that some cats out there may be less (or different) picky from ours.  See my review of CAT-MAN-DOO BONITO SPRINKLES for info on several products I "tested" in search of a flavor/appetite enhancer, including this shrimp version and another F&amp;S tuna treat product that was much better received by our gang of four. This is a very very good tea, bearing the name Sibu. English tea is really nice and really really really really really good. These chocolates are absolutely the best, smooth in taste and almost delicate in texture. Their an absolute MUST for any chocolate fan, I\'ve never been a fan of milk chocolate, but these Fazer chocolates are the absolute exception! I highly recommend these chocolates to anyone who loves chocolate as much as i do! I\'m of Russian descent and have been eating buckwheat for my entire life. I live in the US and usually buy buckwheat in local Russian or Eastern European stores. This is the first (and last) time I tried American-made buckwheat. Here are things that I found.&lt;br /&gt; 1. It takes only 10-12 min to cook this. Normally, it takes 25-30 min. And this item is not branded as an "instant buckwheat"&lt;br /&gt; 2. It tastes quite different than "usual"&lt;br /&gt; 3. There is a strong metallic smell&lt;br /&gt; 4. This item is overpriced. Just go to the closest Russian or Eastern European shop and buy the same thing 4 times cheaper. When we lived in Omaha we fell in love with Pears coffee.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  For the price there is really no comparison.  We\'ve tried other flavors, but always end up going back to colombio supremo.  We are now on direct ship every three months with Amazon.  Try it.. it\'s better than the grocery store options and less expensive. I bought the 4 pack of this coffee based on the reviews of others and the price. It is a lot of coffee, since we drink less than 1 pot per day.  I really enjoy the flavor.  I put a little cream and sweetener (agave nectar) in my coffee, but this coffee has great flavor that comes through.  I\'m not super picky on coffee, but I can tell when I have "bad" coffee.  This is definitely good coffee and I plan to keep buying this coffee as the only coffee we have in our house. Awesome tasting Tea in a 16 oz. can!  I highly recommend this product because it taste great and doesn\'t cost a lot. Prince of Tea brand teas are great. The premium oolong tea is good, but I found that I like their organic oolong to taste better than the premium, and it generally costs less too. Prince of Tea is a well known and environmentally concious company and you\'ll do well to buy their products. I started loving Oolong tea after I discovered a bottled product called \'Tejava\'. That product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle. I needed something less expensive so I tried this \'Prince of Peace\' brand Oolong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few brewing experiments, I now love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have learned; If brewing as \'sun tea\' this type of tea seems to come out very weak. If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling. I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea). I have, to my taste, duplicated the \'Tejava\' brew at a fraction of the original cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ken I drink three cups of this each day, made with one Oolong tea bag and one green tea bag, in a large mug.  I believe this has helped me to lose about 8 lbs. in the last five months.  I drink it without sweeteners, and also cold. The price for this is very reasonable, and the taste is mild. Unexcelled as to price and equal in quality to the best ! I have been drinking oolong tea for several months now. I find it quite a nice morning beverage instead of coffee. It is also a great pick me up in the afternoon. One of the benefits of oolong tea is increased energy, which for me it works. This oolong tea is great tasting and light flavored. I will definitely continue to purchase it. The tea tastes great hot or iced.  Very good for the price.  I recieved the package fast with no problems. I\'m drinking oolong tea because Dr Oz said it would raise metabolism, the jury is still out.......really how would you know? I have lost weight but that\'s because I quit drinking coffee which I added too much cream to and started working out a lot more. It does not taste the all that great so I add 3 equals and drink it after it cools. Superior flavor, not too green, not too black. Loved it from the first cup.I put a hint of Splenda/Sugar blend in mine and am substituting it for coffee these days. Stumbled on it in  a shop but will be getting it thru Amazon in the future. I am here now because after tasting it I wanted to be sure I could buy it on line and have it delivered to the door. Again, a definite yes product! maggiemay I want to give my cats as much variety as possible. They are family and they matter. Variety makes them happy. And their health &amp; wellbeing are important. Giving them good, healthy food and treats are apart of showing them how loved they are. Unfortunately, I have to go online to find some treats as the stores don\'t carry the variety any more. It only takes a cursory look at my reviewing history to realize that I haven\'t exactly made a career out of rating gum, but this new Trident Vitality is so darn good that I thought I\'d better get in a few words on it. I\'ve tried all three of the available flavors and can\'t seem to choose a favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Peppermint with Ginseng flavor reviewed here is definitely pretty awesome. The gum has the physical profile of an old-school Chicklet. It only takes a bite or two for the strong peppermint flavor to kick in. And man, does this gum LAST. I can usually go a good 3-4 hours and still get some flavor out of this stuff. That makes it a good value in my book for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically retails for around $1.39/pack at my local grocer, although I\'ve caught it on sale for under a dollar once or twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. Hi, i ordered this product from another website but i wanted to post a review on here since it has the same product.&lt;br /&gt;Okay first of all the packaging looks nice and neat not messy like others, just pure and simple...maybe too simple?.&lt;br /&gt;they dont give the ingredients info which is an automatic fail, on the back it says "allergy warning CONTAINS: SOY"  another fail&lt;br /&gt;they dont tell us what the gum does, does it whiten teeth? fight bad breath? or what!? you know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has the word "Vitality, which means active" but thats all they say nothing more?....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the taste is like any other gum I would have to say that my dog is a picky eater. I have tried all types of different brands of food and finally found one that she loves. She also suffers from skin allergies and even though she is on meds I think this food has helped a bit with her dry skin. I only have one issue her breath smells really fishy after she eats but thats not even a big deal anymore. Also the price is cheaper than other online stores like petco and petsmart plus free delivery. All in all If Mona\'s happy so am I. The Natural Balance Alpha Grain-free Trout, Salmon meal and Whitefish Formula is working very good for my dog. There is no digestive problems. It also keeps the fur shinny. Be sure to provide a lot of water for the dog as he always drinks a lot an hour or two after the meals. I moved to Las Vegas from San Jose last year and have been missing my Peet\'s Coffee Jasmine Downey Pearls tea.  When I saw this product I bought a shipment right away. I was not disappointed.  I love the individual silken sachets of Jasmine Tea pearls.  It is fragrant and wonderful tea. I will be buying it again. Harney &amp; Sons\' Dragon Pearl Jasmine tea is one of the cleanest and most delicate of commercially-available teas I\'ve encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first experience with it was at the Williamsburg Lodge, in Virginia, where it was served over the 3 days of an annual convention I attend there.  While a shame to have to sip it standing up or moving between speaker sessions, I had a remarkable sense of being elevated above the rush around me.  The bouquet is evocative and tended to linger in the air yet was in no way overpowering... more like a stroll through a jasmine-studded garden.  Upon tasting, the first impression seems to register near the tip of the tongue, as if sweet, and as the flavor develops in the mouth there is a recognition that it is, in fact, tea but without insistent tannic or other strong overtones.  A fine impression remains when the cup is set down and the intake of breath recharges the sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no settling of heavy flavors-- a cup is as fine and pleasurable from first sip to last.  I also have found that this tea maintains its character despite the array of waters I have used to make it.  Some brews become distinctly unpleasant when the leaves are introduced to certain mineral-rich well water or treated city water.  The best experience no doubt is when using filtered water, but it is not requisite to enjoying Jasmine Pearl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a wake-me-up tea on a work morning, I would likely choose a more robust leaf.  However, for a proper moment of relaxation-- or an attempt to induce one in the midst of chaos!-- I hope to never run out of this tea. Works good in the blender for shakes and ice slush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can not find decaf in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can add other flavors and spices to  taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for nutrition builder. I really wanted a decaf product so didn\'t have a lot of options. This powder essentially makes a chocolate flavored blended drink, even when I use cold decaf coffee or espresso as the "base", the chocolate is what you taste. When I think of an iced coffee drink, I think of coffee with a hint of chocolate (mocha) not the other way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers point out, the 150 calories is for half the packet and no milk added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try a different brand next time. I\'m still on the hunt for a mix that creates the same flavor I\'ve experienced once in a great while at a coffee shop. Or like the iced blended at a west coast chain (CB&amp;TL) that is overpriced to have shipped (and I think is available sugar free)! I love Big Train! There is a local shop that sales Big Train Products.  After spending $20 a week on the stuff, I decided that I wanted to make it at my house sometimes to save a little money. The individual bags are the exact bags that the local shop uses.  I do prefer the consistency of the product when made by the shop, I think that has to do with my blender\'s age.  Overall, this product is super yummy! These are so good, my next order will be on the monthly schedule.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to make and super delicious. We used milk and chipped&lt;br /&gt;ice, along with the mix. I might try water one time to see how&lt;br /&gt;that is. I wish I could rate this product higher than 5 stars. I used to go to a local coffee shop to get these drinks for about $4. Now I can make them at home for a fraction of the cost. They are delicious! I like the single serving packets, but my husband and I end up using three packets to make two good size drinks. This product is delicious!  It is the frappacino mix a lot of independent coffee shops use.  You will not be disappointed. Big Train Decaf Mocha Blended Coffee is so very, very good.  In my later years I find I do not tolerate caffine well and it has been hard to find a decaf to replace the coffee treats I have created for myself...with caffine.  This is great...Makes a lot and will keep it in stock with auto reorder on Amazon...to save even more money and be certain I do not run out. This is a delicious oil. The walnut flavor really stands out. We keep this oil in the refrigerator, to preserve freshness and taste. Definitely shake it well before each use. Everyone comments on how good it tastes whenever we use it. So, it\'s pretty universal in its appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We make a salad dressing using this walnut oil, blood orange vinegar and honey. The ratio of all ingredients is 1:1. E.g.:&lt;br /&gt;- 1/4 cup blood orange vinegar&lt;br /&gt;- 1/4 cup roasted walnut oil&lt;br /&gt;- 1/4 cup honey&lt;br /&gt;(adjust to your taste buds)&lt;br /&gt;Mix with a blender or hand blender (or by shaking the jar, but a blender mixes much better, especially with the thick honey). Wow, is this a wonderful salad dressing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, we use this blood orange vinegar: "Cuisine Perel Blood Orange Vinegar", which is available via Amazon. It has a wonderful flavor. I make an extended butter using this oil, water and liquid lecithin.  It is just the BEST tasting spread ever and much healthier because of the walnut oil.  I keep mine refrigerated to preserve that wonderful taste and aroma.  It tends to settle out so be sure to shake it before using to get the full flavor and consistency. I didn\'t know to do this on the  first container and when I got to the bottom it was very thick, almost sludgy, with the roasted bits.  Amazon\'s price is pretty fair although I can occasionally find it locally (TJ Maxx)a bit cheaper. But I must say ordering from Amazon and getting it shipped straight to me is VERY convenient.  I\'ve never had any problems with damaged or leaking containers on this product (well maybe a small dent in the metal but that\'s all). I\'ve used La Tourangelle roasted walnut oil during the barbeque season for the past four years or so. It\'s a great product and I won\'t fire-up the hibachi without it. Along with various vinegars, I\'ll splash it on mushrooms, peppers and whatever veggies I have from the garden.  (The main dish is usually tofu, but I have a special marinade for that.)  One 500 ml can lasts me about one season while the other two keep well in the refrigerator. From what little shopping-around I\'ve done I think the price would be hard to beat. Flavor 5 STARS:  First time I used the oil I poured some in a saute pan to scramble some eggs. It ended up being an earthy mushroom like flavor. I loved it.  I pour it on my dogs food occasionally and they love it.  I wanted to buy this originally because I watched the Dr. OZ tv show and he recommended ingesting a little every day for its anti-inflammatory properties.  I gave some oil to my Aunt who has an auto-immune disease and she likes the oil as well. I would definitely buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ding for metal alloy container: It is cheap metal and though it was packaged well by Amazon.com the containers probably got dented in Amazon\'s warehouse because it didn\'t seem like the packaging should have caused the dents.  The way it was packaged if there was any damage it would probably only be dents to the containers so I would say "expect" dents with any shipment of oils if this company uses the same cheaper kind of metal alloy for their containers.  Dents do not make the product taste worse so I do not worry about the taste.  I will return it if the containers leak but that would not stop me from ordering again.  However, the odds of leaking happening probably statistically is not "often" if you receive shipments regularly. La Tourangelle Roasted Walnut is the best tasting oil I have ever had. My old favorite was Avocado oil but this is even better and keeps longer. I pour it on everything. Make a great mayonnaise. Spinkle on baked stuffed shrimp or baked fish. Drizzled on steak or chicken and as a topping for pasta and bruschetta with some garlic, parsley and parmesan cheese. Addictive so you\'ll want to have it in the house all the time. Buy it you will love it. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5EJQ"&gt;La Tourangelle Roasted Walnut Oil, 16.9-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had already ordered this and had two left in my refrigerator, having given one to my brother.  He shared it with mutual friends, who loved it too, so I ordered another package for Christmas gifts to those who had fallen in love with it after tasting his sharing.  I then used it (1 C.) in my peanut butter chocolate chip cookie recipe (see review of Skippy Natural Creamy PB).  This arrived today and I have to cheer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you SO much!  This product was securely and SNUGGLY packaged in the perfect sized box so it did not slide about or damage itself!  THANK YOU SO MUCH AMZ for giving due attention to appropriate and PROPER packaging to these three cans of walnut oil!  PERFECT! (YAY!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is lovely and so yummy that I also ordered a set of the Pecan oil too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PO7FBW"&gt;La Tourangelle Roasted Pecan Oil, 8.45-Ounce Tin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, remember to check out the others - pistachio, hazelnut, pumpkin, almond, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great answer for those of us with non-nut food allergies (Dairy, Soy, Gluten, Lime, Mint, Grapes) that allow us to use these oils to give some enchantment to our cooking and baking.  I subbed it for the peanut oil in my PB cookies and it added a nice note to them.  Like Christmas!  YUMM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, (like so many other helpful reviewers advise) to keep it in the refrig! wow.  I read the great feedback on this product and took the plunge and was not disappointed.  We had bought some other walnut oil at WF and this one blows that out of the water.  The flavor, aroma, and price are second to none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fav recipe so far:&lt;br /&gt;take a large yam/sweet potatoe, cut in 1/4 inch strips lenthwise (like a long potatoe chip).  baste in oil and salt.  broil for 10 min per side.  enjoy! We have used this product before and love it, so decided to send some as a gift to friends.  The cans were received dented.  Two of the cans were significantly dented.  The 3 cans were taped together, but no other packaging was in the box.  One side of the box was torn.  The shipping receipt was not included nor was the "gift" message that we had requested.  Our friends had no idea where these 3 beat up looking cans of Walnut Oil came from or who sent them until we called and asked if they had received them.  Shipping was also suppose to be in 2-3 days.  Was not received until day 6.  Will find another way to purchase this product, but not through Amazon. In a "feeling carefree" moment at the grocery  -- I purchased a can of this oil thinking to myself I would be tossing ~$7 in the trash later, but I was always curious about that little shiny metal can of Walnut Oil..  Yesterday, I took the plunge and OMGz is this oil awesome!!  I put it to use in my pasta sauce, replacing the Olive oil, and it was delicious!  The can says to refrigerate immediately after opening to preserve the oil, but I do not think its going to last very long before its empty.. Always a fan of La Tourangelle oils, this time the hazelnut oil was received as a gift via Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the oil wonderful and delicate for salads, and some sauteeing, Amazon now packages the cans to come dent free and protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy! I enjoy the flavor and use it for much of my cooking and add it as the oil to my home made granola.  It does not cook well on high heats (as advertised), but does well at medium to low heat.  It\'s health benefits far outweigh vegetable oil and canola oils.  I use both this and coconut oils whenever possible for flavor. The toasted flavor is so much better than regular walnut oil; the price is the best I can find and we store it in the fridge for longer life. This is the good kind of fat, and tastes great.&lt;br /&gt;I actually like the taste better than butter.  It has a similar quality- rich, indulgent, blends well with foods, and it is way healthier than butter.  Not as aggressive tasting as olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;I have substituted it for butter every chance I get, with good results. (disclaimer- I\'m not much of a cook...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please buy this, so Amazon will keep it in stock for me.  It costs much more in stores, and is hard to find I almost can\'t put into words how much I love this product - the packaging, the flavor, the health benefits, the price (especially with the subscription discount) - fabulous!  The vinaigrette recipe on the can is phenomenal - I mix up a couple of cups of it and keep it in a squeeze bottle in the fridge, use it on greens, antipasto, and grilled chicken.  I use the oil straight for the finishing touch on a lot of items.  Recently I found myself with a last-minute invitation to dinner and not a lot of ingredients in the house to throw together a contribution - settled on a white bean bruscetta with a drizzle of this oil, and people swooned.  It elevates everything it touches. So happy I got this on a subscription. I might even have to increase the frequency that it is delivered. I\'ve used it in everything from scrambled eggs to brownies. It\'s not mild like olive oil, but it has enhanced the flavor of everything I\'ve cooked! I ordered a set of three cans and they showed up yesterday in perfect condition (no dents).  So far I have made some boiled red potatoes and seasoned them with walnut oil and sea salt.  I also roasted some yukon gold potatoes and english squash with the oil and it turned out wonderful--the walnut oil gives it a great flavor.  I will be giving one can to my parents.  Since my mom is not a fan of olive oil it will give my dad a new flavor to play with in his cooking. The walnut oil is really good. I later will often come to buy it.I hope you will like it too. Enjoyed the product, pleasant flavor,  used it to in all my cooking, i will be purchasing it again. Cans were dented on arrival... but did not harm the product. I had bought small cans previously and they arrived inadequately packaged, so they all had tiny dents. These, however, arrived undented, well-packaged in bubble wrap. I have not yet opened them, but I have used the small cans. This oil is great quality, and the price is not overblown. Recommended. We\'ve been using walnut oil for many years; we brush it on toast to take the place of butter, eliminating much of the saturated fat from our diets. It\'s also wonderful in salads--try it tossed into greens with a few nuts and chopped stone fruit or grapes, and a fruity vinegar. This product is of excellent quality and Amazon has a great price for it. the walnut oil has a wonderful taste to it.  I have used it in salads, salad dressing, couscous, and a variety of other things.  Thank you for a wonderful product.  Definately worth the money. This oil has a wonderful, mild, roasted walnut flavor that I found irresistible in a salad dressing (it will now be my go-to oil for homemade dressings).  There is a recipe for vinaigrette right on the back of the can.  Bought it because it\'s omega-3 content is second only to flaxseed oil, plus, it\'s made in California!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buy it on Amazon, so much cheaper than the grocery store. We ordered this on our Doctor\'s recommendation and take a tablespoon every day as a supplement. It\'s supposed to have several omega acids.Also tasty on salads. Walnut oil is an essential ingredient in our favorite waffle batter. This oil is the best we\'ve used for the price. GREAT aroma!!! great product and priced well, we\'ve ordered this several times over the past few years and really like their walnut oil,  packaged well and ships on time, will keep ordering this product from the same seller I love the walnut oil. It came in cans which i like a lot because you hardly see them any more. The walnut oil was better quality than any of the walnut oil I bought in my neighbourhood and cheaper even with the shipping charge. I recommend it to anyone. La Tourangelle makes some really good oils. I like this company alot...try the sesame oil too. what a fresh smell and a very pleasant taste.&lt;br /&gt;it,s very good for you too. I use it in place of olive oil, for salads and cooking. One of my favorite salad recipes I make often calls for walnut oil.  I bought a small bottle from a local major grocery store and it was over $10 for about 6 ounces.  Steep!  I love walnuts so naturally I loved this oil from my very first taste.  But the price was not right so I searched on the Internet and found this.  I was a little reluctant to buy 3 cans as I thought they go rancid before I can finish but I am now on my last can.  I use it in place of EVOO to make other vinaigrettes too.  Or just splash this walnut oil and my favorite raspberry vinegar and B&amp;S (or seasons salt like Krazy Salt) over spring mix, it is an easy but great green salad! I do this a lot when I need a quick side. Anyway, this oil goes well with anything and it does not taste too nutty.  Just a touch of nice walnut flavor (of course, I love walnuts so even if it tastes very "walnutty," I would still like it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it is a great product and I will buy the same pack again! This is a great oil for baking it gives a nutty flavor. It also works great in dressings much better than olive oil. I found the oil a bit weak in taste. I had expected a stronger walnut flavor. I hope it is not chemically produced like most truffle oils. I really wanted to like this, as it was organic, and came in a glass bottle, but there was hardly any flavor at all. I could barely smell it, and even when I poured a generous amount on my dish, it imparts little to no truffle flavor/aroma. My truffle salt is much more potent. I enjoyed the carbonation with a hint of blackberry and liked the fact there are no calories or artificial sweeteners. This was not good. The flavor was lacking and barely came through unlike the Hint water -- which I really enjoy. I wanted this to be good and was so excited to get it but it just disappointed. This product helped us tremendously. When our 2 year old daughter started day care, she wouldn\'t eat at the center and she began losing weight. We started her on Pediasure in the mornings as an insurance policy that she was getting enough nutrion. It worked great she stopped losing weight and actually started gaining :). She loves the taste, especially the strawberry flavor. This is awesome! it really helped my daughter gain the much needed weight for a reasonable price. Will do business again :) Glad to find this for a birthday present as hard to find decaf ones in store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes good ice slushy and milk sakes cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who can not take decaf, these are , and making them at home sure beats Starbucks prices. This coffee mix is so easy to make and taste great.  I enjoy ALL their flavors as my kids do too.  Hard to keep around.  Buying a box of it at a time helps. Personal preference... too sweet.  Tastes like General Foods International Coffees.  Price is great if you like that, though.  And makes up very easy. This product was okay tasting. My problem with it was the 10 oz container with less than 6 oz of sprinkles. Really?!? Strong, dark, intense. Strong enough for a man but mellow enough for a woman. It really is a good coffee with no bitter after taste. I just love it. It\'s good with cream and sweetner with no watered down taste or just plain. Wish they made a decaf then I could drink it 24/7. I love Taco Bell\'s grocery items, so I was excited to try this new rice. Unfortunately, it was disappointing. This is more of an imitation Spanish rice than a Mexican rice. It is tomato based, and very sweet. I expected it to have more of a taco type seasoning (cumin, garlic, etc).I cooked the rice for the recommended amount of time (90 seconds) and this came out very mushy and sticky, mostly clumping together. The flavor was too much for me, since I do not like sweet rice with my tacos. I would not try this again, and I would be hesitant to try another flavor. If anyone is looking for delicious and healthy snack, Doctor Kracker is an answer.  However, the hard crispiness is for people with good teeth. These flatbreads are definitely my favorite cracker, but they\'re messy when I break them apart to have something closer to bite-sized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution: Despite the description that they are made with spelt and good for people with wheat issues, people with celiac disesase cannot eat these. Spelt has gluten and the flatbreads contain barley malt. I love them and heartily recommend them, but please don\'t misunderstand the nature of spelt and accidentally serve them to someone with gluten intolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, yes, great price at Amazon compared to my local grocery store. I hope that advantage continues. With all the meds I take, I have a lot of problems with my stomach. I try a cracker first, when nausea hits, with Gaviscon or Tums being the next up to bat if that doesn\'t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are so wonderfully yummy that I then bought the Pumpkin Seed Cheddar too! The flatbread is great alone, or used instead of bread.  The crunch is intense, although I love it that way. I keep these next to my chair and next to my bed and look forward to trying other flavors too. Have tried many crackers, including some other Dr. Kracker, and think this tastes the BEST.  It\'s hard/crunchy with lots of seeds on it, so if that\'s an issue, it might not be for everyone.  Buying it in Amazon\'s 6-pack makes it less expensive than purchasing in the store. I eat them just like this!  I like something with substance to it, and when you eat these, you know you\'re eating something.  They\'re healthy, taste good, and are reasonably priced. This is one of the best dried organic crackers around. Highly recommend them compared to other available types of similar products. Could not stop eating these after the first taste!  High quality ingredients make a big difference.  Love the crunch and the seeds.  The subtle sweetness is nice too, much less heavy-handed than in most products. Love these crackers and all of the Dr Kracker products.  I use Subscribe and Save to save a little bit of money and to insure that I don\'t run out.  I pretty much eat one every day instead of bread.  My current favorite topping is goat cheese! I like these crackers so much I just ordered a different flavor.  These are very crunchy and satisfying.  I put two crackers into a zip lock baggie.  Break them into bite sized pieces and this is my treat throughout the day and into the evening and they are very filling.  I do recommend them however I don\'t know how well they\'d go over for those with dentures.  Because they are so crisp and because they have seeds of various sizes.  Very good find.  Love um. I am always on the lookout for healthy but tasty foods that are low in calories. These crackers are good, not in a "omg" type of good, but they have an interesting yet addictive taste that I can\'t really explain. I would definately recommend them. Everyone I give them to keeps asking me for more. I guess I should stop sharing. These are delicious and filling. I first had them in Hawaii a few weeks ago but then couldn\'t find them when I got back home to Philly. Amazon had them and a good selection. If you are a seed and nut eater and like a crispy cracker you will love these. Enjoy! Thanks to the wonderful reviews I read about this crispbread, I decided to purchase. There are many other crispbreads/crackers that I\'ve purchased that taste like cardboard and have little flavor.  I think this crispbread is really delicious - a little sweet with lots of crunch and a variety of seeds. Great flavor.  I like that it\'s organic, whole grain, and relatively high in protein.  It\'s a little different from other crackers and it is great topped with egg or tuna salad or all by itself. Delicious! I will have to try some of the other Doctor Kracker Crispbreads. I will certainly be ordering more of these. These are the only crackers that I buy.  So Healthy and so good.  Eat them with a salad and you have the perfect lunch. These crackers are a great healthy snack without anything spread on them. My only dislike is that they are a tad too sweet for me. I\'d like them without the molasses. Outstanding product...I am always going to have them around.  Far and above most crackers for taste and good nutrition. Each of these flatbread crackers has 4 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber, and only 100 calories, so they\'re substantive and filling by themselves. However, because they\'re so firm and sturdy, they make a good base for more complex snacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One very simple addition is to sprinkle shredded cheese on top of a cracker and microwave it until the cheese melts (~15 seconds). You could even stack another cracker on top before microwaving to make a tightly-bonded cheese-and-flatbread sandwich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just about any recipe you would normally make on top of a cracker or on top of a piece of toast can work here. This flatbread is just delicious. I love all the various seeds, very crunchy. There is a hint of sweet but in a delicious way. I love these flatbreads. I smear mascarpone on them and then so many diffferent things on top of that to make a wonderful snack or lite meal. Their very crunchy and tasty. I watch my diet closely since I have Diabetes and these crackers are very low in Net Carbs in addition to tasting good. The other flavors are good too. I\'ve twice now had to move up their delivery since I go thru them quick. You\'ll love em and will have fun trying different toppings for them. I really like them with Lox, mascarpone cream cheese and Dr. Kracker...don\'t forget the capers. This is an excellent product. It is healthy, delicious, has a great texture and feel in your mouth and goes perfectly with hummus or other spreads! Just tried the Doctor Kracker seedlander crackers today and they are delicious! I\'m going to try their other flavors soon. Can\'t believe how good these are. the first moment you bite into this cracker, you will notice the difference.  This tasty, crunchy, organic cracker is perfect with soup or salad.  It is certified organic, using quality ingredients.  The cracker is dry, not greasy or oily like a typical potato chip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;comes in several different varieties and flavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* recommended * These are wonderful!  So crunchy and they\'re made from whole spelt as well as seeds and a big helping of tasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found them remarkably filling too.  They\'re nice and big.  It would be easy to make these the basis for a light meal adding just a few toppings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these sight unseen and never tasted so I had no preconceived notions.  I\'m very pleased and will order these again. These crackers rock.  Wish company would let you buy assortment since you have to buy minimum of 6 boxes at a time. These are excellent snack crackers, but you need a really good set of teeth to bite into them!  We have eaten them plain but they are probably excellent with cheese also.  The interesting thing is that once you manage to bite a piece off they are not hard to chew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chock full of healthy seeds, these are great for either a snack or to accompany a bowl of soup or a salad. I subscribe to these now &amp; switch around to the different flavors sometimes. High in fiber and trace minerals, I mostly eat these with diffeent flavors of sardines (kippers), tuna, and anything else that would go good with any other crackers. This is part of my change to a healthier diet, that I started about 6 years ago, now at age fifty. My blood pressure &amp; cholesteral are the best they have ever been. My dentist has even stated my gums are looking healthier (no more bleeding gums) a first for me. On line with the teeth issue, these probably are to hard for those with loose or weak teeth. But if you want a decently tasty cracker, to replace bad snacking habits, their probably isn\'t anything better. I first came across these at Jason\'s Deli, so I googled them and read reviews as you are doing now.If you are not sure if you will like them try getting them at your local deli. They usually have a couple of flavors and are the smaller cracker not flatbread, but taste the same. Also over the years I have modified what I eat, first I started as a lo-carber, mostly eating my favorite meats etc., but my triglicerides were always high, so I started adding sardines &amp; more nuts &amp; fruits, skipping more often some of my favorites like fried chicken. But have found excellent &amp; flavorful alternatives, dark chocolate Almonds, some Sara Lee breads, lo-carb brands of tortillas.I still fall off once in a while &amp; eat out often, but always get back on course. I feel better and healthier &amp; actually enjoy &amp; look forward to eating all the varieties of foods I\'ve painstakingly researched over the years. Which I keep on hand, so as not to eat bad too often. These are the best crackers I\'ve ever eaten.  two crackers spread with cheese feel like a meal to my belly. I spread them with aged bleu cheese, omg good!  Why have I never tried or even seen these before? This is the only oatmeal that my family will even consider eating.  I make it in the crock pot overnight and it is always ready when we are.  I use my small crock pot for the two of us.  I start with a 1/2 cup of oatmeal; add a dash of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla; add a 1/2 cup of milk and 2 cups cold water.  Place the lid on the crock pot and plug it in.  It will be ready in the morning when you are.  I let mine cook approx 10 hours.  My small crock pot has no settings- just off or on.  We love to add some brown sugar and dried blueberries or Craisins at the table. I make a bowl of McCann\'s every morning in the little crockpot for my breakfast; add a banana, and it\'s perfect!!  Try it and you\'ll never eat \'the other stuff\' again!! I\'ll be honest, if you want a quick breakfast don\'t purchase this oatmeal. But, if you have time to spare or don\'t mind waiting for some "good eats", this is the oatmeal for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1. pour some milk into a sauce pan; Step 2. add a dash of salt [or salt to taste]; Step 3. add oatmeal, making sure it stays covered by milk; Step 4. turn on stove to low heat [not too low but definitely not too high, as you don\'t want the milk to evaporate/dry out leaving you with tough oats in pan] and cover pan; Step 5. do some little cleaning to built up appetite making sure to ck on progress periodically; Step 6. add more milk if oats are still too tough and let it simmer for a little while longer; Step 7. get your ladle/just pour directing into a bowl add a few raisins/cranberries/your favorite dried fruit and ENJOY! Purchased case of 6 cans from Amazon.com for [...]  bucks including shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality slow cooking oatmeal. Good shelf life on cans. This is the slow cooking type 20-40 minutes depending on preference. Taste is good. My daughter and I eat low-carb. Which oatmeal is not really, by the way. But I was looking for something that we could eat in the morning that was not meat/dairy/egg, and was gluten-free, and filling, without being pure sugar like most breakfast foods and especially grains. I decided to try these long-cooking irish oats. We use 2 cups water and 1/2 cup dry oats, for 1/4cup dry each. It takes this stuff 30 minutes+ to cook so it is not fast food, for sure. But strangely enough, it\'s filling. Adding fats (couple tablespoons of cream) to the serving helps that of course. In any case, it is much tastier, and much more long-lasting for keeping us satisfied, than I expected, and surprisingly stable on blood sugar. Nor has it set off cravings like most grains, fruits, etc. do if we eat those; the sugars digest so slowly in this apparently. It is more solid and nutty than the flakey quick-oats I grew up with, which I now consider a gummy gluey sugarbomb insult to true oats. These are harder to find and cost more but they\'re worth it. Perhaps some of you are like I was... wanting to take advantage of the health benefits of oatmeal, but uncertain how to prepare it so that you and your family will actually eat it. After experimenting a bit, and reading lots of recipes, I\'ve come up with a simple, yet tasty way to prepare McCANN\'s Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal. Give it a try, and you may decide that oatmeal can be a healthy and delicious addition to your breakfast menu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recipe:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Start by bringing 3 cups of water to a boil (about 3 minutes in the microwave).&lt;br /&gt;- In a medium saucepot, melt 1 tablespoon of butter then add 1 cup of oats. Toast the oats on medium heat for about 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- Add the boiling water to the toasted oats and simmer for 25 minutes. Don\'t stir. It should get to a soft bubbling simmer.&lt;br /&gt;If it boils to hard, you stove is set too hot, so turn it down or it will burn.&lt;br /&gt;- Add 1 cup of milk (or can do with a mix of milk and buttermilk).&lt;br /&gt;- Cook an additional 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes 4-5 good size servings with excellent texture and consistency. It thickens once it sits a little bit. You can increase or decrease the milk to adjust the consistency as desired. You can also save it for up to a week in the refrigerator without much difference in taste. Just store in small sealed bowls. Each can of McCANNs oatmeal makes about 16-20 servings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone likes to top and sweeten their oatmeal differently (sugar, brown sugar, maple syrup, raisins, etc.). Only add the toppings when you\'re ready to eat it, not before storing in the refrigerator. For my serving, I like to add 2 tsp of brown sugar, a sprinkle of cinnamon, about 1/2 tbsp of butter, and then top with chopped pecans. Very tasty. Hope you enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be kind enough to indicate if reviews are helpful. I like it, it reminds me of food from my childhood. Not something I\'d eat everyday.  Kinda like the way I feel about grits. You need to cook them for a long time. How you serve them makes all the difference in the world.  Great for baking, but you have to know the product before you try baking with it.  Taste?  Real wholesome, good stick to your ribs food, takes some effort like granola. Healthy eating?  Yes. If you follow the cooking directions, in my opinion, you have wallpaper paste.  Cut the cooking time from 30 minutes to 20 minutes, and it is much better - a little chewy, but that\'s how I like it!  Breakfast takes more planning now, since it\'s a longer cooking time than my old brand - but good taste and worth it. We were introduced to McCANN\'s oatmeal a few years ago by close friends.  We were able to find it locally in a few stores near where we live.  However the these few stores gradually became fewer until the product was no longer available to us.  This left us with the internet as the only option for obtaining this product.  Hopefully this resource will not fade away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyce Very satisfied with this product ; excellent flavor and texture; recomment for those looking for good  breakfast choice Delighted with my first ever Irish Oats/Steel Cut.  As a Diabetic this should help me with my blood sugar -- natural carb with a slow release!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cook up a batch in the slow cooker and use left overs (microwave) for a couple of days.  Great . . . will be purchasing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks McCann\'s and Amazon. I have been having Quaker Oatmeal for yesrs until trying this today! The texture and the taste are completely different from the pressed oat. It worths cooking for half hour. My son love it at the first bite! My 8-month-old baby is also love it! I uaually cook the portion which will be enough for 2~3 days. Drop one spoon or two into the worm milk every morning to make my breakfast much more healthier! This one is so good that it will be hard for me to go back to pressed oatmeal..... The oatmeal inside the canisters was good.  However, the packaging by Amazon was terrible.  Every single can arrived dented, and several of the cans popped open.  Amazon treats products terribly... I haven\'t ordered from Amazon in a long time, not since they sent me expired Pirate\'s Booty, which I tossed.  I thought they had gotten better and decided to give them another try.  What a  mistake.  Never again.  Customer service at Amazon leaves much to be desired, as well.  IF you get someone, they\'ll probably speak broken English and be very hard to understand.  Then they will not understand the problem.  You\'ll have to ask for a supervisor who, you hope, will speak better English.  Be prepared to wait a LONG time for a supervisor, and you may be disconnected several times before actually getting through to a supervisor.  The supervisor will ask for every piece of identification imaginable, not short of your SSN, before saying, "Well, what do you want me to do?"  "Uh, you\'re customer service... Service the customer???"  Amazon has lost my business forever. I really like this product to add to water so that I don\'t have to drink so much Gatorade and sweetened/acidic beverages.  I use this because I have very low sodium levels and my doctors do not want me drinking "free water".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that it didn\'t arrive when promised and I didn\'t have it in time to take with me on vacation. I ordered these for my upcoming wedding candy buffet. I am doing all navy and white and these go perfectly. They are individually wrapped and a true navy color. The packaging was great. Each lollipop is wrapped in bubble wrap. Love them! These lollipops are are well done, look exactly like the picture. Not a single one was broken! They packaged each lollipop so nicely, very impressed! Perfect! These are great vintage looking lollipops for our vintage wedding. Good quality. Pic on Amazon selling page is what you get. About ten years ago my wife and I stayed at a small resort near Domenical, Costa Rica.  Lizano was on every table in the restaurant.  We were quickly hooked.  Lizano goes great with eggs, beans, rice, tortillas, pork, fish, etc.  It\'s really tasty and nothing taco sauce or steak sauce.  We\'re on our second case now.  Give it a try. About twenty years ago, I visited Costa Rico, and on my very first night, I stopped at a small restaurant, and ended up eating what is the typical dish. Rice, with some vegetables mixed in, also some chicken. The chicken and veggies are chopped up into small pieces, and all of it is cooked in a pan, and served warm. It is really good, but what really makes it is the Salsa Lizano, which used to be on every table in Costa Rico, now you may have to ask for it, as it is really popular. This salsa is great on cabbage, chicken, rice dishes, just about anything. I always made a point of bring a bottle or two home with me, as it was not possible to purchase anywhere in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Trust me, try some of this stuff, you will not regret it. Also, it is not what I would consider a hot sauce. Sure it has a little heat, but very mild. My baby enjoyed this flavor when I purchased it at a store.  I ordered a case of it from Amazon.  the whole case arrived moldy.  Each jar popped when I opened it too, showing that it was properly sealed.  I contacted Earth\'s Best.  They said they would look into it but would not follow up with me.  Given what is going on in our food industry, I will not purchase any more products from this company.  It is to scary when feeding a baby.  Amazon refunded me but did not take it any further.  Be very careful and inform other families too.  UPDATE: I was so disappointed with the lack of concern from Earth\'s Best and Amazon.  I contacted the FDA, they referred me to the USDA because the product contained meat.  They took it very serious and had also received several complaints.  They have come to my house and written a report.  If anyone else noticed this problem please contact the USDA (1-888-674-6854).&lt;br /&gt;to report your claim/problem.  They will investigate the problem and the Earth\'s Best Plant to make sure they are following regulations. I tested this one on my twin 10-month old babies and they liked it immediately.  It was their first beef and their first spinach.  I had already given them chicken and they really like it so they are not vegetarians yet anyway.  Mostly I wanted this product for the spinach and the higher iron content.  Somehow they made this particular flavor brand tasty for babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like getting these by the case rather than buying them a jar at a time at the store since 2 babies eat so much.  It\'s good to keep several flavor brands around too I think, to give your baby a variety.  I\'m sure I\'ll get another case when this one is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients per the label: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Finely Ground Beef, Organic Spinach, Organic Garbanzo Bean Flour, Organic Tomato Paste, Organic Whole Durum Wheat Flour. CONTAINS: WHEAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has 110 calories, 31% protein, 100% vitamin A, 8% vitamin C, 4% calcium and 4% iron.  I\'ve been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult. My baby enjoyed this flavor when I purchased it at a store.

They will investigate the problem and the Earth\'s Best Plant to make sure they are following regulations. I ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained Chicken Apple Compote Dinner. It contained 3 of this variety and he liked the first one but the others, although properly sealed, were solid and moldy and stinky.&lt;br /&gt;One of the Turkey dinners in the flat was also improperly sealed; the lid popped. We were lucky because I just happened to check that one. Now I\'m so paranoid that I check all of them several times. I called Earth\'s Best and they assured me that they haven\'t had this problem before and that I shouldn\'t worry about it. I\'m so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer. Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also recently opened 5 other jars in this flat after my son refused to eat them and realized that they were rotten.  3 of them were completely solid and domed at the top!  We poked a toothpick down to the bottom of the jar and it was dry throughout.  Shortly after eating his last dinner of this box, my son started vomiting and refused to eat.  We have contacted the USDA about this.  If this happens to you, please same your jars so you can give them the information they need.  It may prevent other babies from getting sick.&lt;br /&gt;I\'ll never buy anything from Earth\'s Best again! Yes I read the other reviews. And given the review dates and my other experiences with Earth\'s Best I was not too concerned that the problems mentioned would still be an issue. And they were not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have tried almost all of the gourmet line of Earth\'s Best and these are great for adding protein to your little one\'s (LO) diet. Google the Earth Best\'s website for complete nutrition info. Most 2nd stage food have between 2 and 3 grams of protein a serving. This one has 5grams of protein and only 2 grams of sugars. Our LO likes the taste and we like the ingridients and nutrition profile. Recommended. I don\'t think it\'s EB, I think it\'s Amazon. I buy EB from Babies R Us, Target and Whole Foods, and haven\'t had any problems. It\'s only the shipments from Amazon that come moldy. Organic, and loaded with calories, fat and protein, this the ONLY baby food with meat that my picky little one will happily eat.  I\'ve found that very few groceries carry this near my home (and I live in metropolitan Seattle) and so I\'ve resorted to ordering it by the case from Amazon.  The free 2 day shipping Rocks! When I saw some of the Earth\'s Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.&lt;br /&gt;  My children have previously enjoyed many Earth\'s Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.&lt;br /&gt;  I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.&lt;br /&gt;  I don\'t know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too?&lt;br /&gt;For more durable items, I still order from Amazon, but I canceled my subscription of the Earth\'s Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first. I also ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained The Turkey and Wild Rice Dinner.  One of them was also improperly sealed; the lid popped.  We were lucky because I just happened to check that one.  Now I\'m so paranoid that I check all of them several times.  I called Earth\'s Best and they assured me that they haven\'t had this problem before and that I shouldn\'t worry about it.  I\'m so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer.  Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?! We had the same issue with this product. Half the flat was improperly sealed, and resulted in an expired food issue.  But you can spot the unsafe jars because they have dried up &amp; turned solid, resulting in a different sound when shaken.  Also, when opened, these "bad" jars are mounded up in the middle and have a rotten smell.  It may be that the product was frozen in shipping, and the expansion caused the seal to break.  I have requested a refund from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our baby did love this meal though - it was like Thanksgiving dinner.  The ones that were still edible were delicious, and are one of his favorite foods. This jar of baby food has 7 GRAMS of FAT and 110 calories - thats triple the fat and double the calories of most baby food!  I highly recommend for babies needing to put on some lbs - as well as picky eaters.  I have to offer my son a variety of 7-8 foods each meal (cheese, avacado, chunks of meat...etc) b/c he turns up his nose at so much (and I can\'t just say \'well too bad\' b/c he desperately needs the calories!) But this is one of the foods he rarely turns down.  I highly recommend. I wondered why my 10-month olds liked this one so much when the other reviews weren\'t so promising.  Then I noted that it has twice the calories as the green bean casserole and sweet ingredients that are proven winners with my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here\'s the ingredient list: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Mango Puree, Organic Finely Ground Chicken, Organic Whole Grain Brown Rice Flour, Organic Yellow Split Pea Flakes, Calcium Carbonate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything that starts with carrots and mango is going to be fairly sweet, and this one is sweet.  The consistency seemed very normal, perhaps because it has plenty of water - that\'s the first ingredient.  Unlike most Earth Best flavor brands, this one has calcium.  The stated amount is 35% of their daily needs.  I\'ve been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this particular one, Chicken Mango Risotto, because I think babies will tend to like it as mine did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cases are being delivered to my home constantly, different varieties of Earth\'s Best subscriptions.  On occasion a case will arrive in a mess with one or more broken jars. Over time I figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage. Now when a case arrives with one or more broken jars, I report it and can get credited for the broken ones only. Of course it\'s messy when a jar is broken, but I don\'t have a store nearby that sells this product except one that lists it at a higher price. The other reviews are very outdated &amp; old. We never had any issues with the quality of this product. My daughter loved it; I loved the fact that she was getting good protein. Most of the other earth\'s best baby foods have carrot/squash/sweet potatoes, which is fine, however my daughter was turning orange from so many orange veggies. I liked that this one had NO orange veggies in the ingredient list. Slightly more expensive than other meals, which I think is due to the fact it has a lot of meat in it. My daughter thinks this tastes nasty, and I agree. She is sensitive to carrot, so I was looking for a food for travel that delivers protein but doesn\'t contain carrot. Though she eats homemade turkey and peas all the time, she wouldn\'t even take a full bite of this. I tasted a little bit, and I can see why. If baby likes that\'s what matters! Happy baby! Happy mommy! Only thing is the color of food that stain anything, but, oh, well, just washed right the way! I\'ve read other reviewers comment on the calorie content of this flavor and it must be high because when I was trying to wash the dish I served it in in was quite oily.  Also, it has a bit of a grainy texture and I think my 6 month old son finds the spinach a little difficult to digest. My 7 mo old despises all things fruit-related (we think it\'s too sweet for her) yet she likes this one just fine!  I\'m perplexed that so many other reviewers say their baby hates it, although I must admit I haven\'t tasted it myself.  For us it\'s a tasty way to get her to eat a little more fruit every day. I purchased this product from B-R-US when it was on sale and my son seems to like it. I was scared of previous post of mold and I ALWAYS double check the food before I stir and serve. He seems to like it, but I recommend the Chicken Sweet Potato dinner. Let me start by saying my 7 month old son, who is used to my home prepared baby foods LOVES this, as a once in a blue moon convenience meal! I\'ve tried it and it tastes pretty good to me too. Rare in the baby food industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am following a weaning guide that I used for my daughter, and it makes you pretty wary of commercial baby foods as babies easily get used to the bland, watery taste and sometimes take a lot of coaxing to go back to home made, healthy meals, resulting in picky toddlers and children. My daughter is now 3 and has never refused a home cooked meal yet, and I attribute that to the hard work I put in in the first year. Another problem with commercial baby foods is that they are usually so padded out with water that nutritional needs aren\'t fully met during the day and babies can start waking in the night due to genuine hunger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\'d love to ask, who came up with the magical 4oz measurement for all stage 2 baby food jars and packets, though? My son takes more like 6oz of my home prepared meals which are much "fuller", so I\'ve had to add a little sweet potato to this to increase the volume. And it does seem really quite runny and padded out with water, so I add a teaspoon or 2 of rice cereal to thicken it up a little. Before long, I\'m sure he\'ll just be on 2 full 4oz jars when I give him this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I\'ll reiterate, it is really quite tasty for a commercial baby food, and I have no problem giving it to my son once in a while. I do recommend! The Earth\'s best \'grourmet\' line is heavy on the protein. And as far as I know adequate protein is important for babies and they need, like the rest of us, good iron levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beef and spinach contains 5 grams per serving. You can check your cans, but most of the other\'s we use the protein is 2 grams. Our daughter likes it. It is also the least expensive of the \'gourmet\' line and this is not something I could find in local stores. Recommended. I was looking for another dinner to try and decided to spend the extra money on this one.  I thought.. my son loves chicken and mangos so why not this. He is not a fan. He will suffer through half a jar, but will not finish a whole one. I guess it was a little too exotic for his 9 month old taste buds.  We will keep trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He loves, loves, loves the beef and spinach and will almost cry when the jar is gone. This was NOT a hit!  It\'s bitter, like maybe the carrots were not sweet and/or not peeled?  and the main ingredient is carrots! (amazon should include the ingredients for all items) Quality control seems to be an issue. This is the second "gourmet meal" flavor with this issue. I had never had a bad experience with the EB products before, very disappointing. My girls seem to like this food - they\'ve only ever shown an opposition to green beans.  But it is SO messy.  It\'s apparently tomato-based, and it gets everywhere.  Where we usually just wipe their faces gently, you really have to clean them.  It simply turns their skin orange.  And the bowls and spoon end up crazy oily, even after soaking. My 9 mo. old daughter only eats earth\'s best products and loves all of them - that is, except this. I can\'t figure out what it is, but we finally concluded that it smells a little like catfood. I tried feeding her this mango chicken flavor a few different times and she would only eat a few bites. I gave up and donated the rest to the food bank hoping someone else\'s child would like it. I have had a good experience with the "subscribe and save" products in general, no broken jars and the quick delivery is great. I find that it is cheaper than whole foods (even with the coupons). This is the only flavor of earth\'s best baby food that my daughter dislikes. For what it\'s worth, I suggest skipping this one or trying it in a variety pack first. My picky eater LOVES this flavor.  Each jar is 110 calories &amp; 5 grams of fat so this momma LOVES this flavor as well.  I\'m ordering more because it\'s the one flavor (besides green beans) that I know my son will eat. This is a terrific baby food.  It has beef and spinach AND tastes great!  It was the first meat baby food my son would eat.  I tasted it myself and it\'s quite good. My baby is 8 months and I purchased the gourmet meals pack. She really liked this one best out of all of them. My daughter loves this!  She is picky so she doesn\'t always eat as many healthy foods as she should.  This flavor gives her the vegetables and protein that she needs.  It is a little bit grainier than other stage 2 foods but still very usable for babies over 6 months. I have never had a problem with anything from Amazon.  I have ordered about 30 cases of Earth\'s best baby food.  This is the most tasty and nutritious variety they offer.  5 grams of protein, and 15% iron! I have it on my subscribe and save.  He can\'t get enough of this, he eats it everyday! Earth\'s Best is supposed to be one of the best baby foods, but apparently my son does not have a palate for their food.  Maybe he did not like the texture of this stuff (it looks gritty).  He normally eats anything but was very sluggish with this food...turning his head after a couple of bites. It was bad before we open them. I saw them when we got. I did open. It had some spot green color. I did not know what it was. I was very upset. Do not buy this product. When I saw some of the Earth\'s Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.&lt;br /&gt;  My children have previously enjoyed many Earth\'s Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.&lt;br /&gt;  I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.&lt;br /&gt;  I don\'t know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too?&lt;br /&gt;For more durable items, I still order from Amazon, but I canceled my subscription of the Earth\'s Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first.

We live in the middle of nowhere so we end up ordering a lot of spices etc. that can\'t be found locally.  This gives great chipotle taste with just a little sprinkled on.  I\'m going to order a few more of these because I never want to run out of it. The breeder of my puppy uses this, and I continued to feed with this supplement. Dog loves the taste, and makes her boring dry food more interesting- she gobbles it up. I notice her coat is beautiful. Good ingredients. I would recommend this. This is for puppies the bag is super small!!!The bag didn\'t last more than a day. I thought it was funny when I got the bag I thought it was a gift to be honest!!! My dogs love these and even my allergy dogs can eat them too !!&lt;br /&gt;thanks for have these on your site again 5 stars! and paws up for old mother hubbard  &amp; Wellness treats&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;Pepper Love Old Mother Hubbard biscuits (we\'ve tried these as well as the puppy variety) are the only true biscuits my dogs like! They would eat the whole bag if I let them. The only thing I don\'t like is they contain wheat, but as long as your dog doesn\'t have a wheat allergy, it\'s no big deal. I would definitely recommend them. Use these as treats for my five labs.  Use only this type as they contain the ingredients I am looking for and are a great size for labs.  Ordered them for years.  Dogs love them. My dogs really did not care for these. were not real p-nutty. I bought these for my wife for her birthday, she LOVES chocolate and its a staple gift I give her. Well this year I got her these. She only ate one, and put them away. Very strange. Later I caught her putting them in the garbage. When I tried one I quickly realized why, they taste like they have no sugar in them, and leave an aftertaste that reminded me of badly burnt toast. I had to brush my teeth to get the taste out. We had a good laugh about it. Fortunately I also gave her a necklace which she really did love so they didn\'t ruin her birthday. 43 dollars wasted. I\'m not much of a chocolate and peanut butter person, but these chocolates are the perfect combination of both.  The different flavors have definitely made me a fan. Bought this for my chocolate lover boyfriend and he loved it ! he shared it with me and they were delicious. Thank you! some of the best chocolates i ever tasted. If you are a chocolates lover then you have to try these You can taste the quality and care that goes into these chocolates. Great flavor, I highly recommend it. You have to try for yourself! I purchased this coffee to make iced coffee drinks.  It has very little \'coffee\' taste, and the dark chocolate taste is more chemical than chocolate.  Similar to the taste of flavoring used in baking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing this coffee again.  My suggestion to those considering a purchase . . . buy something else. I never drank coffee in my life - received a gift of Ghiradelli chocolate flavored coffee for Christmas - searched on line and found this Dark Chocolate Decadence. It is the absolute best - have it on bi-monthly subscription order now with Amazon. If you are a fan of dark chocolate - this is a wonderful coffee - very smooth with just a hint a dark chocolate in the background. Delicious sweetened with honey and milk. Also divine with Almond Milk or Vanilla Soy Milk.  Coffee Masters make wonderful coffee. I am big coffee lover.  This was some of the worst coffee I have ever had.  It smells wonderful but the taste is horrible.  I would not recommend purchasing this coffee at all. i love that i can get both flavors in one container. and at the asians store around where i\'m at they go for about a buck, sometimes more. so this is definitely a good deal and even cheaper when you subscribe and save Same stable and good quality of Meiji Yan Yan. When I got the good deal from Amazon.com, the price is even better than those available in local Asian store, which is really rare. I bought these for my son\'s 12th birthday party favor/goodie bag.  It\'s hard to put together a goodie bag for 12 year old boys, but this is something that everyone likes! It\'s exactly what I wanted. It\'s yummy. Make sure you eat your chocolate dip before the strawberry, because you won\'t like it the other way around. It\'s perfect. This mix is easy to prepare and very tasty. The only prep work consists of cutting up a zucchini which takes less than a minute. The seasoning is excellent, very flavorful but not too spicy. Sometimes low-salt mixes are spiced up with a lot of pepper but not this one. Excellent for vegetarians. I have a One:One Coffee Pod machine and have ordered pods online before.  These looked good and sounded like high quality coffee- albeit a little pricey for 12 pods.  This was the worst cup of coffee I have ever tasted!  It left a bitter taste in my mouth that lingered for hours.  Yuck!  Don\'t be fooled by the fancy name and packaging. It tastes like rocket fuel.  Fortunately, Amazon refunded my money when I explained how bad it was. Throwing the whole box away! Several of the seller\'s listings indicate 20% Kona blend.....but the delivered product does NOT have this package printing.&lt;br /&gt;As a long-time Kona coffee drinker, the contents are more indicative of 10% (or less) Kona coffee. Have ordered twice....and completely disappointed. My dog loves this flavor. Quality of cookie overall is very good. This particular smell drives him crazy!! On Amazon I get much chipper than in a store. Dogs love them and they are made the best way, They are about $4.00 cheaper that the pet stores and no tax Old Mother Hubbard treats are the best and at a reasonable price. Their treats come in a lot of different sizes and flavors. They offer a variety of products that all dogs will love. My three black labs love the peanut butter and Bac\'N"Cheez. Received the shipment promptly but to my dismay, it did not contain the mini treats I had ordered, but "small", which were not that small.  I have very small dogs and I really wanted the minis. I contacted the seller (Petco) and after several days, they responded that I could return them but if I reordered minis, they would still send the small because Amazon had the item numbers wrong and they don\'t have minis. They said the simplest thing would be to return them for credit. This did not seem economically feasible, so I am breaking each one into small pieces which is very inconvenient. We live an hour away from any stores that would carry this product so it\'s easier and cheaper than making the trip. It definitely smells like dark chocolate but the taste is just average.... I can\'t say I taste the "dark chocolate decadence".... And it\'s not that strong but usually I like stronger tasting coffee. The first batch I got must have been a bad batch, because it seemed to have a "burned coffee" smell, and smelled a bit more like chocolate raspberry or some other flavor rather than pure chocolate. It made me wonder whether Coffee Masters uses the same equipment to make both a chocolate raspberry flavor and the dark chocolate decadence flavor, and if the flavors got mixed during the manufacturing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have ordered it several more times and have been more satisfied with it. There are times, however, when those burned flavor notes creep back in, depending on the bag. I sometimes wonder if Coffee Masters overroasts their beans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this coffee instead of the chocolate coffee I used to regularly enjoy but could not find on Amazon, Brothers Gourmet Coffee Chocolate Swirl.  The Coffee Masters Dark Chocolate Decadence bean is darker, oilier, and richer than the Brothers bean.  The Brothers bean coffee is milder, more like Swiss chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still might prefer the medium-bean Brothers Blend over this coffee, even though it is a medium bean and not a dark bean, as the flavor profile tastes more like real chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I am now actively seeking out coffees that are fair trade or direct trade or advertise ethical practices. Those that ignore the plight of the farmer and show no transparency in the process of the coffee from field to table I do not buy any longer. So this brand is no longer one that I will purchase. Plus they engage in farming activities that are not ecologically sound. I suggest starting with Intelligentsia. Sounds corny but oh so true.  The aroma is pungent with the savory smell of coffee and the sweetness of chocolate.  The chocolate flavor is rich yet delicate so it doesn\'t overwhelm.  I purchased four bags of the ground coffee first for my daughter.  She insisted I taste it even tho I don\'t like flavored coffee or \'dark\' chocolate. I enjoyed it so much I took back a bag and purchased 4 bags of the whole beans to grind when needed for that added freshness.  While I will not drink flavored coffee all the time, I feel it\'s a treat to start or end my day with a cup of this delicious coffee. My daughter also enjoys this coffee cold. We like to mix this with regular coffee because it\'s so strong and rich by itself that it makes it go further and isn\'t too overpowering. Another great hit from Coffee masters!  This one has a rich, dark chocolate flavor that\'s not too intense but just right.  The coffee is foll-bodied and very smooth.  I will definitely order more from Amazon. I have really fallen for flavored coffees and I consider these to be some of the best-- so much so that I\'m on the regular shipment list now.  I\'m sure I drink too much of this but I love the flavors.  Try it, I\'m sure you\'ll like it. We really like this coffee, it has great flavor and we make it strong. We do the subscribe thing and it works out about right. This like yummy homemade hot cocoa, with the benefit of being a delicious cup of coffee, too!  This is a GREAT deal!  Get it while it lasts!  Good to the last drop, you could say!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy! You have to put a lot of sugar in  this to make it taste good. The coffee just by itself kind if has a stinky smell like a poopy diaper or a pee pee poo poo puppy in a cup. Next time I am going for raspberry flavored coffee...cause the chocolate is like poop. YUCK. My female Pixie Bob cat, Pawnee, is extremely finicky about her canned food.  She will touch nothing but Instinct\'s rabbit formula, and licks her plate clean each morning.  The Instinct brand is nothing but the best, whether it is a canned formula or dry. This is a great food and my cat loves it! The only thing that seems a bit strange to me is the difference in consistency between batches, and even the difference in consistency between the 3 ounce cans and the 5 ounce cans. Seriously, it looks like a different food, with the 3 ounce cans looking much smoother in texture, and the 5 ounce cans looking much more "grainy". I hope that the following review will help someone with a cat that has stomach issues similar to mine...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many, many products aimed at helping with digestive upset for my cat. Her pain and suffering was so great that I thought I was going to have to put her to sleep. I went to multiple vets and had thousands of dollars worth of diagnostics done to try and find out why she was having acid reflux, crying and subsequently vomitting (endoscopy, xray, ultrasound, bloodwork, etc). One vet told me to just give her pepcid. This worked for a while, but then became completely ineffective after a while. The same vet then told me that she probably just has food allergies and would have to be on steroids for the rest of her life, and thats all that could be done, and prescribed different kinds of Science Diet (which we all know is actually a terrible food for cats with digestive problems).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, what do you know, the steroids didn\'t help AT ALL. I tried probiotics of various brands for pets, I tried digestive enzymes, I tried many different natural products designed to help ease digestive / intestinal inflammation.... I tried a homiopathic vet (the only one in my area) and spent a few thousand more dollars rerunning tests and running other tests for pancreatitis, etc. I tried MAKING her food from raw meat to try and eliminate food allergies to commericial foods as a potential problem, etc. I TRIED EVERYTHING, but still my cat was constantly licking her lips, then crying in terrible pain and vomitting very consistently, and now was losing interest in her food and was losing weight and starting to look boney. I was determined to not give up on her though. I had just lost my wife to infection during a failed bone marrow transplant / cancer during all this, and was not about to give up on my girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped making her food and started getting her Natures Variety canned Rabbit formula and the duck formula. She loved the food but it did not seem to be helping her feel all that much better, even though a lot of other people were having great success. I then found a site called wellvet dot com that said that the Ulcinex was very effective at repairing ulcers and the stomach lining in pets. It also said that it was very effective at controlling vomitting that occurs a few hours after eating, which is EXACTLY what was consistently happening, and no other product that I had found so far claimed to do same thing. I was skeptical as soon as it started talking about chinese herbs and such, but I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started giving this as prescribed from wellvet ALONG WITH Georges Aloe Vera juice (the one without preservatives and no taste), which is said to help a lot for acid reflux sufferers (I found a few people that said it worked great for their cats), and continuing the rabbit / duck formula. All the while praying, within a few days I started noticing a drastic improvement. She was licking her lips less, and was able to relax for longer periods of time without jumping up in pain and crying. She vommitted once within a several day period. Several days later, NO MORE CRYING, and instead of hiding behind the bedroom door licking her lips the whole night, she started sleeping with me at night like she used to. Now, several weeks later, she is literally 90% better. NO MORE VOMITTING AT ALL, is in very little pain, VERY little lip licking and only very occasionally at that. She also gets much more rest, and has put on several pounds and is back above her normal weight and has a nice chubby belly. My cat suffered daily for 2 long years during this whole process before I found this and the other two mentioned products. The aloe vera juice on its own didn\'t seem to completely do the trick, so I think its the combination of the three things that is really effective. I only hope that no permanent damage has already been done, but now I have my cat back and don\'t have to suffer through losing a great wife and a great cat. If you have a cat with severe stomach issues, you owe it to yourself and your cat to try this along with the Georges Aloe Vera and Ulcinex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006IICOM"&gt;Metagenics - Ulcinex - 90 Tablets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV9TA0"&gt;Warren Laboratories - George\'s Aloe Vera, 64 fl oz liquid&lt;/a&gt; I was at my wits end with hypoallergenic foods for my cat with IBD. This one is one he will finally eat, and even ask for. Nothing is more heartrending than trying to get a sick cat to eat, and putting expensive prescription food down to have him sniff, walk away, and cry for food.. I was so relieved when I found this. My cat is now maintaining.. I pray they continue to make it for years to come! We tried all flavors for our cats and the rabbit was the apparent favorite for all of them. Took a recommendation from catinfo.org for this food as it is closest to the diet that a cat would naturally eat. Coats are softer and glossy. Energy levels seem to be up. Quite pleased with the results so far. A few years ago, my cat was diagnosed with food allergies that previously undiagnosed had led to IBD and then Pancreatitis. We went through just about every limited ingredient food to find one he would eat consistently.  He finally settled on Nature\'s Variety Instinct. Lamb and Rabbit he\'ll eat every time and all the time. Duck and Venison, he\'ll also eat just not always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He still suffers from IBD and will have pancreatitis flare ups if given chicken, but his coat is soft and shiny. He\'s active (at 13 yrs old). And he rarely throws up. I couldn\'t survive, he couldn\'t survive, without this food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\'m glad the company finally started to make 3 oz cans. Mr. Picky doesn\'t doesn\'t like leftovers. It doesn\'t hurt as much to toss out 1.5 oz as it does 4 oz. I have been finding quality food for one of my kitties who has developed an allergy to chicken.  I hesitated on this brand because of the price, but then when I saw how limited my choices were I broke down and ordered a few of the flavors.  I have to say I am very pleased with the quality.  I also ordered some Evo venison and duck as well as the Natural Balance limited ingredients venison with peas and the duck with peas.  Neither of those COMPARE to this brand and my cats testify to that as well as I do.  The texture is so much better and she loves these the most.  I have gotten her the rabbit, duck and venison and she eats them all with more relish that either Evo or Natural Balance.  I do have to say that of those lesser brands, the Natural Balance venison does have a nice texture and not as "pasty" as the duck with peas.  Mabel wasn\'t as crazy about it though, although she did eat it all but not with the same excitement as the Instinct brand.  When you are having a problem with a cat that can not or will not eat something, when you find something she will, it is worth it\'s weight in gold!  This brand is a keeper. Why is it so hard to find rabbit-based cat food??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to give my cat variety in his diet; his main foods are mostly poultry, but I like to keep the fish and red meat to a minimum.  After my last cat was diagnosed with diabetes I did a lot of in-depth research on feline diets.  One veterinarian who\'s written extensively about homemade cat foods was fond of using rabbit as a poultry alternative because it\'s closest to what a small cat would eat in the wild.  It\'s particularly excellent to supplement a diet when the cat is sensitive to fish (as many are).  It\'s also higher in fat than fish - many fish-based foods I looked at only took 15 to 20% of their calories from fat, and a cat needs more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This food fits the bill!  It\'s got an excellent ingredient list.  It\'s grain-free, which is what I consider to be the most important qualification, and doesn\'t contain animal "meal" or by-products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three reasons I\'m giving it four stars instead of five.  First, it\'s expensive.  Rabbit meat, by weight, is going to be pricey, so I\'m not surprised...but just because I think it\'s worth the price doesn\'t mean I wouldn\'t like to pay less!  Second, my cat isn\'t crazy about it.  It\'s got a ground texture and he\'s very fussy about only eating shredded meat.  I solved this by mixing a 3 oz can of this food with a 3 oz can of shredded chicken (of a different brand) and he gobbled it up.  I just wish I didn\'t have to take that extra step.  Finally, it\'s awfully dry.  It was actually a surprise.  The meat itself is very dry, and the liquid in the can is totally separated.  I think most cat foods use thickeners so that the gravy clings to the meat, and this one doesn\'t.  Since one of the many advantages of canned food is that it helps to keep the cat hydrated - they have a low thirst drive and are built to take in much of their fluids with their food - I was a bit disappointed.  And surprised the first time I tipped what looked like a can full of meat too far to the side and ended up with watery cat food juice on my hand and the kitchen floor!  But this was also solved by mixing it with a chicken-in-gravy food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those complaints aren\'t enough to keep me from buying this food, though.  It\'s still a great cat food with a hard-to-find protein source and a good ingredient list.  It\'s a bit expensive for me to use as a main food, but a can or two a week gives just the right amount of variety. One of my cats developed a food allergy and was throwing up anything he ate. There are many types of food that the vet recommended trying (duck, venison, etc.) but he refused to eat any of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we found this food, and all is good again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness there\'s something he will deign to eat that won\'t aggravate his food allergies! The vet recommended rabbit-based food for my cat, and that is difficult to find.  She seems to be allergic to chicken and the regular cat food menu.  Unfortunately, she\'s not crazy about this food, but that\'s just because she\'s a spoiled brat cat. Just kind of yeast shopping one day. You\'re at the store and thinking, man, I really need to get me some new yeast. This sounded intriguing. An Alt strain, clean and rapid fermentation. Tolerant of cold conditions. In short, it is a hard working and industrious yeast that does its job without much fanfare. And it cleans up after itself. Only the Germans would have such a yeast. It\'s not like the California yeasts that are kind of fruity, or the British yeasts that just leave a mess. It\'s very German.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could easily pass this off as a lager yeast. I did a very simple wheat / pale malt light ale. 1.032 OG. 1.008 FG. Fermented at about 60-62 give or take. Grain to bottle in a week. I wasn\'t too concerned with flocculation or haze but that\'s just me. Cracked on the other day just to get a taste. Extremely clean. You can taste every single grain of the malt. I didn\'t hop it much. Maybe 15 IBU tops with magnum. Very nice lawnmower or pounding beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blow off tube is mandatory. Next project is a 1.062 American wheat. Blew out the airlock. I had 5 gallons in a 6 gallon carboy and it wanted enough space for 10 gallons. Very vigorous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an absolutely crisp, clean yeast that produces very lager like beers and can tolerate temps down to about 55, this is it. Seems to really accentuate malt. Very nice yeast, but I like a little yeast profile so I don\'t know if I\'m in love with it. Just impressed at how clean it is. So let\'s be honest. I have severe anxiety and depression issues which has gone on my whole life. I have been prescribed dozens of different meds to help with it but nothing has. Also, I don\'t have insurance so I literally put out hundreds a month to try new drugs that didn\'t help. More importantly, the side effects were sometimes as bad or worse than my symptoms. I have also tried other natural cures that didn\'t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several of my friends suggested I smoke hemp as a natural cure. I\'m not against it but I\'m not a smoker and I\'ve had professional jobs where I could be tested, anyway. So I thought, let\'s check Amazon and see what natural hemp products are available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I tried hemp powder, which I also reviewed if you\'re interested, and it tasted like sand. It will take me all year to be able to finish the 3 lb bag and that\'s if I ever do. Then I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\'m very honest in my reviews so I wouldn\'t recommend this if it didn\'t truly help. It\'s not a placebo-effect thing, either. I have tried too many meds for that to even be a possibility, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I can tell you for certain is within the first week it greatly and noticeably increased my energy levels. I have done more around the house in the past few months than I\'ve done in the past few years. I have gone through 2 subscriptions of this and the energy hasn\'t gone away. I am a big and tall person so I take 4 in the morning and 4 at night, usually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has depression/anxiety issues knows that sometimes you barely feel like getting out of bed most days. You get a heavy feeling like there\'s lead in your veins. If you\'ve been through it then you understand what I\'m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say with 100% honesty that it has given me way more energy and it has helped with that heavy feeling. Can I guarantee it will work? No. My aunt and mom tried a couple just one time and they didn\'t notice any difference. But it has sure worked for me taking it daily. What I can tell you is that you should at least try it. If it doesn\'t help, just don\'t buy it again. But it is sure worth a try because it might help you as much as it has me. I will take this supplement for the rest of my life, as far as I\'m concerned. That\'s how much it has helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it works for you, too. This HEMP OIL is excellent stuff. For real, if you are using fish oil, this actually has MORE omega 3\'s and has many other medicinal values.&lt;br /&gt;Combine this with hemp seeds (in smoothies) and you will notice a difference in any aches in your knees and your hair will shine and your body will be filled with antioxidants.&lt;br /&gt;ANYTHING HEMP ROCKS. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED in this product and it came on time and was packaged well. (3) bottles for this price is a great value. The capsules are easy for my wife to take, they really help her crohn\'s disease. After reviewing and reasearching we found that hemp seed oil helps crohn\'s disease. She has tried all the prescription meds which if you read the after affects on them they are worse than the crohn\'s disease. This product has really helped her from having to many episodes or being sick as often. I\'m not one to believe in supplements, but this product was the only thing that helped my anxiety. I was getting really bad panic attacks from what my doctor said was anxiety. I feel overall much healthier after taking this product and I haven\'t had barely any anxiety issues. Definitely recommend this to anyone that is trying to tame their high stress or anxiety. Our acupuncturist recommended this to us,  to lower my cholesterol and to lower my husband\'s blood pressure.  So far so good.  We have been taking it for a little over a month, so in a few more months, we\'ll have a better idea of its effectiveness.  We take two capsules in the morning and two at night This is a great source of essential fatty acids without the unpleasant tasting burps of fish oil or flax seed oil, which also doesn\'t agree with my stomach.  I also think it helps my IBS symptoms. I take it every day. I used to take fish oil but when I made the change to plant based oil for my body, it was like night and day. I felt the change, and loved it. This product is excellent! I HIGHLY recommend it... It has the balances of nutrients I was looking for but also non GMO... The product shipped quickly and is very high quality hemp seed oil. I\'m extremely impressed! I can\'t wait to buy my next supply because of all the benefits! I\'ve already noticed a difference in how my skin behaves, how my hair grows and the strength of my nails and I\'ve only been taking it for about 10 days!! I don\'t experience nearly as much nausea with taking this supplement as I do with others (such as flaxseed oil) and I also don\'t have to worry about the presence of GMO substances in it either. Thanks again for selling such a wholesome product :) This has been a boon for my digestive system! I take 3 tablets twice daily -- morning (after breakfast) and evening (after dinner). I haven\'t had any problems whatsoever for at least the last couple of months of taking the Hemp Oil capsules! I plan to continue taking them for a long time into the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I started taking these capsules because Hemp Oil contains essential Omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids in the 3:1 "balanced" ratio, and the capsules don\'t have the "weird" after-taste that plain Hemp Oil does. I purchased the hemp oil for my mom to help with pain relieve. The Omega oils are suppose to help with join movement and pain. I have noticed that when she takes the vitamin her pain is less than the times that we are out and she has to wait. I Love this brand....and please tell EVERYONE you know...Hemp oil is sooooo beneficial for you...do your research...you will understand that getting 3 Omegas and some It is hard to tell most of the time if supplements work but I just have a greater sense of well being when I take this product. It really is a good source for essential fatty acids. I expect to keep taking it. The hemp oil soft gels really help my sensitive digestion (along with the probiotic, enzyme and lactose pills).  Of course, I still have to watch what I eat and how fast I eat it (slowing down really helps bad digestion).  I suggest buying this product in bulk because the more you take the better it seems to help. I\'ve tried most of the Virginia chutney Co. (VCC) product range and particularly like their spicy plum chutney. It is good with cold meats, salads, cheddar cheese, and curries I first tasted this at Petrossian.  I had ordered Green Tea and when I tasted it, I was a little shocked that it was not regular green tea.  I noticed the citron immediately and it was fantastic.  It complimented the tea very well.  The tea is very light.  Au Bon Pain also carries this tea.  Try it out! One of my favorite restaurants serves this tea iced. They were kind enough to share the brand name with me when I asked. It makes wonderful, refreshing and healthful iced tea. Highly recommend. As a gum addict, I was looking for a natural alternative to the artificial-flavor/artificial-sweetener varieties. This gum is great. Now, the flavor comes from real peppermint, so it\'s not going to last as long as the fake stuff, nor it will be as mind-blowingly intense as some of the new super-flavored gums.  But if that\'s ok with you and you\'d like to chew something that doesn\'t put weird chemicals into your body, this is for you.  It\'s expensive, sadly, but what can you expect? Buying it in bulk here helps. I like to chew gum and I also like my teeth.  I am also allergic to most artifical sweetners and it is getting more and more difficult to find sugar free gums that do not contain aspartame.  This is why I purchased this product in the first place.  I like the flavor and it lasts quite a long time.  The packets are the perfect size to fit in your pocket or purse.  I always have some on hand at work, especially for after lunch.  I will certainly be buying more. Very tasty gum and the xylitol is wonderful.  My youngest daughter\'s dentist recommneds that she chew xylitol gum 3 to 4 times each day to help prevent cavities.  Her baby teeth had a cavity in every tooth along with three crowns!!!!  Her adult teeth seem to be much more cavity resistent and I believe the gum is helping prevent the cavities. If you look at the vast majority of sugar free gums in the store, you\'ll see all kinds of nasty chemicals on the ingredients label.  There are a few xylitol sweetened options available online and at health food or vitamin stores.  Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that can safely be consumed by diabetics and purportedly PREVENTS tooth decay and has some other health benefits (research it).  XyliChew is the only brand I\'ve found that I can definitively say is NOT produced in China or sourced from materials produced in China.  XyliChew is produced in Finland.  Given China\'s contaminated products record the past few years, I would trust a product from Finland over China any day.  The gum itself has a nice peppermint flavor that does not last too long.  That\'s okay by me, as I generally just chew this gum after a meal for dental health.  It\'s pretty expensive, but you can get free shipping and a discount through Amazon\'s "Subscribe &amp; Save" program.  XyliChew comes in other flavors, but the last time I checked Peppermint is the only one available through the "Subscribe &amp; Save" program.&lt;br /&gt;**IMPORTANT NOTE: Keep any products with xylitol away from dogs; it\'s toxic to them. Have had this gum from other sources and always liked it. This particular shipment seems to have much less peppermint flavor than before...could be it is older gum(there is no expiration date on it) or they are making it with less peppermint now. Otherwise I received this order very quickly. This is an excellent sugar-free gum for those who don\'t want saccarine or aspertame. Many commercial gums that are advertised as containing xylitol also contain unnatural, chemical sweeteners. The flavor and soft texture lasts very well in the peppermint and fruit flavors. Another family member really enjoys the licorice one. The chocolate has a disappointing flavor, and the cinnamon, which to me tastes like almond at first, quickly gets hard and loses flavor. Haven\'t tried spearmint. While the serving size is listed as 2 pieces, I find 1 is exactly the right amount for my mouth. I\'m into maximizing health. I don\'t use any artificial sweeteners or refined sugars in any form. Xylichew was a great find because its ingredient list is actually safe. This is rare for a gum. The gum has a great taste, it has the right amount of sweetness, and the pieces are a good size. I take half a piece at a time, while my wife prefers a whole piece. If you are looking for a safe gum - this is the one. And Amazon has such a sweet deal on it - don\'t pass it up! The advertised regular price of $99.99 is ridiculous.  5 hour energy drinks are widely available for $2.00 each.  Don\'t buy from sellers who inflate prices and charge ridiculous amounts.  You can get a case of 12 for $20 right here on Amazon. I had a very long day. Got to work early, worked about nine hours, headed for the airport and had to go through a connecting flight and about 5 hours of travel. And when I got home I still had some work to do and needed a boost to get me through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hearing a radio ad for this product, I picked up a two-pack and used one of them when I got home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It promised five hours of energy without crashing. I can\'t attest to the five hours (didn\'t quite pay attention), but it did last for quite a while and I had no crash effect in the end. I wasn\'t overly anxious or nervous, but I could think clearly and get the work done that I needed to get done. So it most definately delivers on its promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things that I like the most is the fact that there is no sugar. I also appreciate the fact that they use water instead of carbonated water, which is the main reason I don\'t like the Monsters, Rockstar, Red Bull, etc products (diet versions, of course). It also gives all this energy in 2 ounces instead of having to drink a large soda can worth of drink. The taste wasn\'t fantastic, but it could have been much worst and only takes a good gulp to get it all down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\'ve been looking for a product like this to get me going in the mornings and this seems to fit the bill. My only problem with this is that it is a bit on the pricey side. Today I am also trying out one that is similar, called Enduroshot, a 2.2 ounce energy shot that claims all the same benefits that this promises but at a MUCH lower price. I\'ll do a review on that sometime soon in the future. If I feel just as awake and alert as I do with 5-hour energy, then I will use it instead. Otherwise, Chaser has a new, steady customer. although the taste leaves something to be desired, 5-hour energy worked very well.  i drank one halfway through my workday, and pepped up enough to go out and wash the ambulance.  my arms hurt later that night, but the product itself worked for me. This is a great price, but every time I\'ve bought these through Amazon, the bottles frequently have dark... "stuff" on the threads of the bottle when you open it.  I\'ve never seen this when buying them from the local drugstore, so I worry that these are either old or maybe not authentic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can\'t say for sure of course.  They do have the desired effect, so I\'m not complaining too much.  It\'s kind of gross sometimes though. well u get the energy u really want for the 5 hours and it really boast u a bit but that u will be calm again and need to rest.. not bad great product The energy drink is a great product. The shipping price is crazy tho. I paid more for the shipping then both products together, so not a great deal. I recently gave up my major 20 year Diet Coke addiction.  I did it for a number of reasons.  I typically wake VERY early to hit the gym before work &amp; needed something to help me wake up at 4:30 AM.  This product is GREAT.  No over-stimulation as it only has the caffeine equivalent of 1 cup of jo. It is also SUGAR FREE and has 0 Net Carbs!! I do feel the energy quickly &amp; it lasts the 5 hours it claims.  The berry flavor is pleasant, but tart so I drink some water as a "chaser" (no pun intended).  I drink water the rest of the day &amp; only use 1 in the morning unless I have a "late" meeting scheduled. Finally, a product that gives you that extra boost you need for anything from travel delays to the overdue stack of paperwork. You feel the effects instantly with more energy and a higher concentration level.  It stays with you and does not leave you feeling dopey or spent when it wears off. This is the best energy product I have ever used. It starts working right away and keeps you going for a long time. I took it at 5am yesterday. It is now almost 3am the next day and I am laying in bed and skin feels tingly, can\'t sleep at all. I feel like I am at super sayan level 4, power of the red monkey. I could shoot ki blast out the window if I wanted too. Maybe some kame hame wave\'s too. I sampled this cake as offered from Biscoff 1 month ago and fell in love.  It is extremely moist and is most delicious when sliced thin to accompany a cup of coffee. The ingredients are perfectly blended as no one taste is overpowering, but you are able to taste each individual ingredient.  If you are looking for a great coffee or tea accompaniment, please give this cake a try! This is the moistest, most delicious cake in the world.  if you like almond tarts, marzipan, that kind of taste, you will be in love with this cake.  Normally I think packaged cake is awful, by the way.  This one is amazing. First, the ingredients list is wrong.  They are almonds, not cashews.  I don\'t have a recent bag (just ordered), but I have seen some with tapioca syrup and some with rice syrup listed in the ingredients.  My 6 year old son has tons of foods he needs to avoid, so these distinctions are important to us!  Luckily, he has been able to eat these and loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pieces in the bag vary in size.  The most typical is about 1-1.5" long by ~3/4" wide.  There will be some loose crumbs in the bottom too.  It looks like they make them in a big pan and then cut them down.  I would compare them to bite-size (or 2-bite sized) granola bars.  It is just the right amount of sweetness added.  I love that these have a nice protein boost when I need to grab something and go. I spent some time searching for an alcohol free rum flavor to make daiquiri sorbet, and LorAnn has produced the best flavor thus far (which tastes outstanding).  It blows away the competitors that I have tried.  Baking with it has not yet been attempted, but I imagine there would be similar results.  The price is quite reasonable for a 4 oz bottle, although it is much more so if multiple bottles are ordered (save on shipping).  It has natural and artificial ingredients; I would prefer it to be all natural, but that\'s a price I\'m willing to pay for the flavor.  I predict this will remain my alcohol free rum flavor of choice. I bought this bag and found it 50% cheaper at smart and final. It was also old and and white. This was terrible! I bought it to put in the candy canisters I give to co-workers. So I didn\'t find out it was OLD till a co-worker informed me. I was so embarrassed. Do not buy this candy. It all ended up in the trash. Very disappointed! This candy was obviously old. Each chocolate was discolored. The Krackel krispies were not crispy and the chocolate wasn\'t right. Peant butter cups and Goodbars nasty, the nuts are horrible. Hersheys pulls their candy off of the shelves in the stores when it is getting old. Seller must have bought it up &amp; sold it here last year or the year before. It has to be at least 1 or more years old. Do not buy chocolate from ZANY Values, it isn\'t good for you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\'m sure that if the candy were FRESH that it would have been just fine. I have re-ordered from a different vendor and will let you know if theirs is fresh (as it should be) or not. Raw is eating from your Organic garden of fresh grown fruits and vegetables.It is also all the nuts growing from the mountains that surrounds us through out the land from the forest. Although grown from a tiny little seed that the sun and rain helps in growth it is our heavenly father our creator God who truly makes them grow and should be appreciated for his gift of life to us all and for our home the planet we call earth .&lt;br /&gt;I used to be a true vegetarian then I went to only eating Poultry and some fish and eggs through out the years.Now I will eat vegetarian soup made with some beef stock but I don\'t care for the meat itself and no pork.&lt;br /&gt;I am still Organic Alternative and Green but I am slowly trying to go back to being that true vegetarian that I used to be however going raw will take a some time because I have a little hard time chewing with my teeth like my friend but after I get my dentures I will be able to adjust into it .Right now I am canning for winter storage.I have dehydrated my whole garden into green super power food that I added to my barley greens. note if you choose to cook get the Fagor Pressure cooker caner That I got it helps make the meals go quicker and is a lot healthier than baking and Broiling or grilling and never fry food.&lt;br /&gt;Well I will let you know how the canning turn out and one day I\'d like to make home made all fruit yes that\'s right not jelly or jam.&lt;br /&gt;Hi Again so far so good I have canned 4 pint jars of my home made spaghetti sauce with 4 of Chili and 4 vegetarian soups with 2 red cabbages and they sealed and are ready for winter when things get rough as around here it is hard to get organics so when I do I get all that I can like I just got up at the farmers market this late fall and then I either freeze them or can them and even dehydrate them.&lt;br /&gt;So I will keep you up to date but I need to try and get some organic fruits and that is hard to get again around here.&lt;br /&gt;well catch ya later as I never say goodbye!Just get this wonderful organic fruit nut and seed mix it has no preservatives and is delicious and affordable and if I can get it you can too. Just remember to soak the nuts and seeds because nature puts some  protective coating on it and they need to break down this to be edible and fit for human consumption. Put two tablespoons. in a large cup of fresh coffee and you have a great coffee mocha.  I have recently tried several others that have been recommended and got great customer reviews online.  None are as good as this one. If you\'ve never tried any of Ghirardelli\'s hot cocoa products you are in for a treat! Made with milk, the cocoa is far superior to any other cocoa product on the market. I don\'t drink coffee, but have a cup of this every morning. When made in the Froth Au Lait hot chocolate/latte maker, you will get the best cup of hot cocoa you ever had. This is the best hot chocolate next to Cadbury bought in Europe.  Our 13 yr old would never drink her chocolate milk until we switched to this (unfortunately we don\'t have a steady supply of Cadbury\'s).  It\'s great! I usually buy this from Starbucks, but after buying this item on sale I will be making my coffee at home. I am not a heavy coffee drinker but sometimes when I have to study I need a quick pick me up and this will do it. I love all their product. Sometimes I add a little cinnamon grade AA and it really gives it a boost. I would definitely buy this product again and I think it is a good price. I saw it for a lot more in the store. We appreciate the short list of ingredients on the Ghiradelli hot chocolate mixes.  The Chocolate Mocha flavor is rich and chocolatey with out being overpowered by the coffee.  This is one of our favorite cold weather drinks. Found this product discounted at a good price at slickdeals.net for about $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time drinking this stuff since I bought it.  I was blown away at how awesome it taste.  This was my first time trying something other than the Nestle brand cocoa (other than the few times I ordered cocoa at a cafe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice blend of mocoa/cocoa and doesn\'t taste too sweet like what I\'m used to with Nestle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely giving this a thumbs up. Heat 8-10 oz 2% or whole milk, not quite to boiling, in your microwave. Add ~1-1/4 rounded teaspoons of Ghirardelli Mocha Hot Choc powder + ~1-1/8 rounded teaspoons of Ghirardelli Hazelnut Hot choc powder, stirring to fully mix. Now add ~3/4 oz Christian Brothers VS Brandy. (Optionally) garnish with whipped cream or a small accent of vanilla ice cream and serve.&lt;br /&gt;Notes: Not to be a brand whore, but Christian Bros (VS, not the more expensive VSOP) is the only brandy I\'ve found to really have the right profile for this recipe. Exact proportions for all 4 ingredients should ultimately be to your own taste. Non-fat and 1% milk are NOT recommended. The brandy should contribute its flavor but not be so strong as to have an obvious alcoholic note. I\'ve for many years used a 1.0 Mocha + 1.5 Hazelnut ratio, but lately the Mocha product hasn\'t seemed as intense, so I\'ve adjusted. You\'ll know it\'s right when the mocha + hazelnut + brandy flavors are in such balance that none is too dominant -- the result will be a new experience "greater than the sum of its parts." I did not expect this hot chocolate to be quite as sweet as I found it to be. It also has more calories than previous Ghiradelli similar hot chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;It has a rich taste and if I were not concerned with weight I would overlook the higher calories. While you would expect Ghiradelli to make good chocolate, the flavor of this mocha cocoa is precisely that of great darker chocolate flavor, using just enough coffee flavor to accent the cocoa without overtaking it.  A smooth, delicious start or finish to your day - even a warm afternoon pick me up on those chilly days! Premium Ghiradelli chocolate mixed with just a hit of coffee makes this a great drink.  I\'ve gotten to where I add a heaping spoonful to my Starbucks coffee every morning.  It gives it an extra coffee flavor and the chocolate for Ghiradelli far exceeds the \'mocha\' chocolate you get at most barista stands. I use this product with my home brewed espresso and milk to make a mocha latte.  It\'s terrific!  I ordered on the auto ship plan through Amazon and save about a $1.50 per can over buying it locally.  Plus I get the added benefit of having it delivered to my door instead of having to drive to a specialty shop to get it!  Great product and great service. I love this hot chocolate. In my opinion, it\'s the best on the market.  It has a nice grown-up flavor of chocolate and coffee. I don\'t know what all the positive reviewers here are raving about. I tried Ghiraradelli\'s premium cocoa mix and found it much too sweet that it was almost unpalatable. And not a very chocolatey taste either. The directions given for one serving are 4 Tbsp of the powder to 8 oz of milk.  Did they meant 4 tsp?  Using their directions would yield a total of 8 cups of hot cocoa -- not very economical for a product with so much sugar.  I had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed. Very bitter!  I couldn\'t taste the coffee at all.  It basically tastes like baking cocoa.  No sweetness, no richness, not coffee.  I bought the 4 pack though, so I\'ve begun mixing it half and half with Swiss Miss (in the can), and then sprinkling it with instant coffee after I\'ve made a cup.  Even making it with whole milk couldn\'t make this yummy by itself.  If you like a rich chocolate taste with just a bit of coffee.... shop elsewhere. I used to drink Ghirardelli Chocolate Mocha hot chocolate as a treat on weekend mornings when I was working.  I\'m now retired and started drinking it every day.  I was afraid that I would get tired of it drinking it every day instead of just as a treat.  Well, that didn\'t happen at all.  I am now what I would call addicted to it.  I have it every morning with my toast and my GMA on TV.  I recently went to my mother\'s place for several days and truly missed my favorite morning drink.  I couldn\'t wait to have it the morning after I got home.  Next time I\'m going to be gone for several days I\'ll make sure I take a canister with me.  I love that I\'ve found this product on Amazon and even that I have to opportunity to have it via automatic shipment.  I started having trouble finding it in the stores we shop so the automatic shipment it great. Love this hot chocolate. Made with skim milk for a healthier delicious hot drink. Creamy and tasty. Will never go back to supermarket hot chocolates. This is absolutely the best hot chocolate out there. It is not too sweet, so more for adults than for kids. Easy to make. Just add milk. No intense mixing required. Dissolves easily. Okay, so let me preface my review by saying that I don\'t drink hot chocolate that often and I\'m from America and don\'t think I\'ve ever had hot chocolate while traveling in Europe, BUT my husband is a British citizen who grew up in India with summers in England and he has searched HIGH and low for a chocolate drink that would remind him of those from his childhood.  We found it in this drink and he wont drink any other chocolate drink now (not even the 47 other kinds that are in my pantry that I bought for him to try and after 1 cup he turned his nose up at them... men). Having liked the various types of Ghirardelli chocolate and premium hot cocoa\'s I decided to try some Ghirardelli Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix, Chocolate Mocha. After trying several cups of this I started to wonder what happened to the Ghirardelli Chocolate as myself I thought it was overpowered with the coffee taste. Not my cup of hot cocoa!! I\'ve been a fan of Ghirardelli Triple Chocolate brownie mix for a long time. And I also like Ghirardelli chocolate candy. So when I came across this chocolate mocha hot cocoa mix I wanted to give it a try cause I love cocoa and coffee. I\'m glad I bought it because this stuff is delicious. I love the combination of chocolate and coffee. The coffee in it is very subtle and definitely not overpowering. It\'s rich, very flavorful, and bold. And as others have pointed out this is the best mix you can buy. I\'m very impressed. Great deal and great transaction!  Finally, an affordable way to indulge my chocolate craving.  Will definitely buy this again! Ghiradelli might not make the best chocolate in the world, but their chocolate mix is my personal favorite. It is rich and mixes easily without the residue in the bottom of the cup that lesser brands suffer from. The mocha flavor is very good with a strong coffee flavor that doesn\'t overpower the chocolate. This is simply great hot chocolate and well worth getting if you enjoy mocha. It also mixes very well in milk shakes! I made this for my 12 year old grandson.  "Grandma this is the best hot chocolate I have ever had in my whole life!"  You can guess what he got for Christmas.  It really has a wonderful flavor.  Top it off with whipped cream. I love hot cocoa and hot chocolate... and have tried many different brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GHIRADELLI is by far the worst that I have ever tasted!  I honestly don\'t have any idea how they ever became famous for their hot cocoa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cocoa has an awful, stale taste... and you can tell that it is made of cheap ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It even tastes worse than the much lower-cost brands like Swiss Miss and Nestle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a REAL hot chocolate, look up MARIE BELLE.  It is thick and rich... not weirdly processed garbage like GHIRADELLI!!! The Chocolate Mocha flavor of this Hot Cocoa is really nice. It\'s different from the usual Hot Cocoa since it has a hint of Coffee. The quality is definitely there, I find it to be better then the Godiva brand. Mixes extremely easily, there is no residue and works with milk or even water mixed with half and half. I must say that it is a bit much of the same flavor, I would have rather 4 different flavors since the containers are big. Worth it though! A++ Best mix on the market for making cafe mocha lattes, and we\'ve tried them all The best hot chocolate,by far.. Not so easily available in my area.&lt;br /&gt;Love the mocha &amp; the double chocolate Easy to use (do not abuse),&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H27NU6"&gt;Ghirardelli Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix, Double Chocolate, 16-Ounce Tins (Pack of 4)&lt;/a&gt; great taste. It makes you to feel good. Try a little sprinkle on ice cream, makes a good milkshake, mix it in cakes or brownies, sprinkle on the cake, enhance coffee drinks and liquors, get rid of that pesky cat, add texture to Barry and Levon\'s 240 pounds of pudding, brown paper mache, movie prop heroin, or dip your bananas in it.  I consume it with BlueBell Homemade Vanilla ice cream.  I like the double chocolate better. Not really sure what I expected, but since I like Ghirardelli chocolate, and I like hot chocolate and hot mochas from coffee shops, I thought I\'d like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, despite following the directions and making this in milk, it\'s not as rich and satifying as I hoped.  I hate to say it, but I think Swiss Miss mixed Instant coffee tastes better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That\'s unfortunate, because this is a four pack of cannisters and I\'m only half way through the first one! love the contents, but two of eight containers were badly dented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jan Great product! Love making this during the fall and winter months because the smell goes through the entire house reminding me of Christmas. Taste great too especially when warm and with cream cheese. Have made it for co-workers who always rave about it. It\'s easy to make up, too. I cannot tell you how many of these I made between Thanksgiving and Christmas!  Fast, convenient and SO DELICIOUS!  I got rave reviews!  Thanks! I have tried nearly all of the Pillsbury quick bread mixes, and this is my favorite.  And of course it is nearly impossible to find in a store in my area so I am really happy to find it on Amazon.  This has a packet of actual diced apple in syrup (sort of like the canned apples for pie).  It makes great muffins or coffee cake also.  You can add things to it, like raisins, cranberries, nuts, etc.  Just super - I recommend it! I bought this product and when it arrived it was not organic.  BEWARE!  The package shown in the photo is not an organic product. This is the perfect size for a snack bag for school.  Minus one star because the glue for the straws also glues the wrapper to all of the boxes.  That\'s annoying. I wonder if the other reviewer\'s order got mixed up at the warehouse or something?  We received organic juice boxes, just like the title says. I absolutely love the Peanut Butter and Strawberry Kind bars! They taste just like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich! These potato chips are probably the best chips I flavor ever have. The spicy barbecue is the perfect mix of flavors! I have had tons of these chips and still they never get old. It fits one person per bag.  After a few chips, you will taste the spicy part.  Every time I see the bag, my mouth just waters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These would be perfect for you if you are getting tired of the other potato chips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the stores, sometimes shipping can be expensive.  If that is the case, most of the times you can find it at your local oriental groceries. oh man, i love this candy! it\'s super delicious, but its really not that sour. I\'d always collect a giant cache of quarters and spend it all on these for 50 cents each! =) Our friends from Germany visited with us a few weeks back, and one of them adores Manhattans. She had them here 15 years back, and when I no longer could find a bottled mix locally, I ordered it from the Internet. This is my first experience with Master of Mixes, and the Manhattans turned out great, just as good as if I had made them from scratch. A great product! I just love this Chili--it is beefier/chunkier than other no-beans chilis and the blend of seasoning is simply outstanding--much more savory and less of an assault to the tastebuds than Hormel\'s in my opinion.  Goes great on a hot dog, a baked potato, good to dip tortilla chips in and a wonderful companion to grilled cheese sandwiches or just toasted english muffins. so anyways, i wished that i could find ginseng tea more easier, but for the price excluding the shipping i suppose its allright. comes in a weird form, not powder kinda like small bits of grass. Taste fine not sour or sweet Packed poorly in shipping and a few had the seal broken because they were rolling around in the box! Very good lemonade mix.  Close to fresh in taste.  Love that it has stevia.  I like it so much more than crystal light or any of the other mixes with artificial sweeteners.  I can take it anywhere, mix it in bottled water, and have a refreshing, healthy, safe, cool drink. Bull Dog\'s Chuno has become a flavorful addition to my kitchen.  I\'ve used it in everything: marinades, rice, stir fries, vegetables, etc.  I\'ve also used it by itself or as a base to dipping sauces.  It also adds a nice component to homemade bbq sauce.  If I had to compare it to something it would be steak sauce.  Everytime I want to change a dish up a bit, I use chuno.  I\'ve bought mine from somewhere else and didn\'t know it came in larger sizes.  The offering here is almost double the size, but it\'s also almost triple the price.  However, if the place I buy it from were to stop, I\'d buy it here without fail.  I just wish they had the 50% less salt version. My dogs loved these...they were cheap too.  Only problem is they are oily to the touch...given they outside is great! Arrowhead Mills Organic Savory Herb stuffing has a very nice blend of herbs for a flavor that compliments chicken and turkey. I especially appreciate the fact that there are no transfats used in this stuffing so I and my family can enjoy it without worry! The stuffing is very easy to prepare, but really adds to the meal. We use it all year long. Why wait for a holiday to enjoy good food? This was a christmas present for my son in law who collects super hero stuff. He was surprised but really liked it. My daughter loved the little tin that came with her Adagio tea set so much that I got her a cannister of this for Christmas.  I think it will end up being a regular gift as we all love it so much.  It really is delicious, and with green tea being so good for you, we drink it all the time.  All the products I\'ve tried from Adagio have been wonderful. I am hooked on it.  It\'s just wonderful.  Highly recommended for taste and flavor and price.  I\'ve tried different teas from different restaurants and tea houses, but I just love this one for home.  I use it nearly every day.  Will be trying more of these teas in the future. I normally hate, hate, hate citrus anything in my tea.  I always thought it tasted the way lemon dish soap smells.  I received this tea in a sampler and wow, I can\'t get enough of it.  It\'s the first citrus flavored tea I\'ve ever liked in my life.  It smells really good, sorta like Froot Loops, and I didn\'t even need to put any sugar or honey in it to enjoy it. The pack of six bottles was delivered in a timely manner but when I opened up a bottle, the juice tasted sour.  I thought that it had spoiled in transit and considered returning the remaining bottles but then I noticed the very bottom line on the product label,"Enriched with Organic Lemon Juice".  It was too much trouble to return and, while I do not totally enjoy the tartness that the lemon juice adds, it is at least still pure and organic and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not have ordered the product had I known that it was not JUST carrot juice but carrot juice with "organic lemon juice" added to it.  Perhaps this is why the price is so very right but I feel misled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes some getting used to if you are seeking the taste of carrot juice.  Before you order this item, I would suggest you buy a small bottle of carrot juice and squeeze some lemon juice into it to preview the effect of having lemon juice flavored carrot juice. It\'s hard to find carrot juice  in stores so I gave it a try and ordered some juice from this seller via amazon....even so I felt kind of poshy doing so.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I will do it again. My six bottles of juice were shipped super fast, packaging was very good. The juice itself is excellent. It is actually that rich in taste that I mix it half with water or apple juice. That way the already reasonable price  becomes even better.&lt;br /&gt;I am really glad I gave it a try. Drinking a glas of carrot juice a day works wonders on my skin. My recommendation? Get a juicer and make your own, or try Odwalla. The taste was bitter, and the smell was strange and foul. The label says "Enriched with organic lemon juice" and that is not pure carrot juice in my book. Maybe it was the lemon I tasted, I don\'t know. I had about three sips and couldn\'t stomach it. This carrot juice is the best.  I\'ve tried so many other brands and this is the tastiest.  We love the Carrot/orange and the Super Veggie too. It\'s healthy and great tasting...can\'t get better then that. Talk about horrible . . .&lt;br /&gt;I was craving carrot juice and the store was out of the brand I normally like which has what I like for ingredients: Carrot Juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did see before buying that it said it had Organic Lemon Juice in it when I looked at the ingredients but I figured that the makers would only add it if it didn\'t change the taste that much.  Well all I have to say is I taste no semblance of carrots at all.  It tasted more like drinking a bad V-8 or something.  Then after sipping a couple of ounces I now have an acid reflux feeling in my throat and chest.  I drink water with lemon pretty often and never have that happen.  So now I\'m wondering exactly how much lemon juice is in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want carrot juice this is NOT for you.  I don\'t even think they should call it that . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\'t normally do it, but I am seriously considering taking this back to the supermarket.  I also think I should write a letter to the company because it is just that ridiculously bad. I tried this carrot juice for the first time today and regret buying it.  I took my first sip and actually wondered if someone had put pickle juice in the jar.  It was awful.  I\'ve had several carrot juices and never had any as sour as this.  It is difficult to fathom how this product is still produced.  It has lemon juice in it, but apparently far far too much.  If you enjoy pickle juice with your carrot juice, you will love this product.  I don\'t. I don\'t know how they did it - but this is by far the worst tasting carrot juice I have ever had.  I think it has to do with the long shelf life - expires in 2012, I drank it in 2010 (well I tried to drink it).  It was probably bottled in 2007 or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YYEECCHH!! First Indiana Jones found the "Lost Ark of the Covenant", then the "Mystical Stone from the Temple of Doom", then "The Holy Grail" and finally the "Palace of The Crystal Skull"...But the loser still cant find "The Lost Lakewood Bottle of Real, Honest 100% "PURE CARROT Juice" Minus Lemons" not without "Short Round" anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to leave "no stars" or fewer cuz, I felt and tasted the pain of other misguided customers, I spewed out my first rancid acidic taste of this clearly labeled, "PURE CARROT" Juice. Lakewood\'s knucklehead faux pas is their troglodytian approach to the label design. I can easily read "PURE CARROT" and "PURE" again, just above the illustration of "CARROTS ONLY" (but nada lemons), but in much smaller print at the very bottom of the label and below the CARROTS ONLY illustration (sans lemons), it mentions "enriched with lemons", 1% to be exact, which means 99% of their marketing team make O\'Donnell look constitutionally wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intentional or not, it aint the keenest marketing approach to "thinking" consumers. To paraphrase a wiser woman, "You might want to rethink those ties." (LABELS in this case)~ E.Brockovich ~.  Even Juicy Juice was smart enough to clear up their ambiguously labeled products.  Today\'s McFly FYI and word of the day is "PURE", and brought to you from my sponsor, "Merriam Webster": PURE : unmixed with any other matter. As in Gold, Pure Gold, Jerry. (I watch tv and commercials, does it show?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an amazing ride courtesy of the "short bus marketing team" see the label here:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Lakewood-Organic-PURE-Carrot-Juice/dp/B0000ZSHAK&lt;br /&gt;Click on the photo and zoom in to find the 1% of Einsteinian logic or lack there of.  Finding the PURE BS or at least 99.9% requires no zoom, matter of fact arms length, like in a grocery store aisle is close enough to be misdirected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok Lakewood, so, think what you will about my criticism be it glib, harsh, frank, curt or possibly even unfair or totally wrong.  On the other hand, I think not but I would love to be proven wrong.  Are you game for a little challenge: Get three 3rd graders, heck even three 3 year olds and give them each 3 crayons, green, yellow and orange.  Now ask them to draw a picture for the label of juice which contains, "carrots and lemons" or if your brave enough for a real acid test, "lemons and carrots."  All I am saying, is give 3\'s a chance! In a world of scams, rip-offs and misconceptions and misdirection...be honest and be excellent to one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No hard feelings, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ret Hink aka Curt Frank aka bombastic sarcastic B@5t@rD Been waiting for this to be shipped for over 30 days.  Might be OK - hard to tell unless they send it. They are very hard to find but whenever I do I try to stock up. Great flavor, perfect for munching on and still pretty healthy. Highly recommended. I purchased this product for my goats initially. I like to give a warm drink of molasses water to my does after they kid and I also give a tablespoon full to any goat that seems to be feeling poorly. It seems to give them a good boost when they most need it. I bought an extra bottle for the house because I have always loved a bit of molasses on my biscuits. Much of the molasses, even that labeled blackstrap, that I have been finding in recent years is bland and seems to lack flavor. This molasses is quite delicious, if you like molasses, and is rich and flavorful. It also has high iron content, higher than I was finding in other brands. Product contains 70% of adult requirement for iron in one tablespoon; yet is safe and gentle on the digestive system.  Ordered and sent to my 82 year-old mother who had had some problems with diverticulitis.  She took three tablespoons a day for a week then tapered down.  She felt stronger in days! My wife has a difficult time getting enough iron, and supplements are very hard on her stomach.  With 70% of the USRDA of iron in one serving of this blackstrap molasses, she can very easily get the iron she needs.  This is not in any way hard on her stomach, either.  It tastes very good compared to other blackstraps we tried - a few have a slight edge on taste but none on iron content.  Blackstrap is an acquired taste but worth it for natural nutrients.  This definitely picked up her step within a very short time (she gets low energy and tired when she needs iron).  We will definitely be buying this again. I bought this for my mother on the recommendation of my family physician.  He said my mom has iron deficiency anemia.  As the name implies, iron deficiency anemia is due to insufficient iron. Without enough iron, your body can\'t produce enough hemoglobin, a substance in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen. As a result, iron deficiency anemia can leave you tired and short of breath.  The solution: boost your iron intake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tablespoon of this tasty delight has 70% RDA of iron and it tastes pretty good too.  If you like the taste of black licorice, I\'d say you\'ll probably like the taste of this. I bought this molasses at a local grocery store and nowhere on the bottle does it state that it is, \'unsulphered\'. I called the company and talked to a sales rep in which he stated that it was not unsulphered. Although it does have a higher percentage of iron, I\'m going back to Plantation. Its a great product.I would recommend this to everyone who wants a tasty sweetner other than sugar.I just started using it,taste so good,the jar is almost finished. This stuff does not taste like black licorice or sweet in any way to me.  It tastes kind of like thick, nasty soy sauce.  I can\'t see how anyone could take 3 tablespoons a week of this.  I barely managed to swallow the teaspoon I put in my mouth.  We eat very healthy and not much sugar but my tastebuds say "no way!" to this stuff.  It does have 70% of your daily iron so I will make some attempts to hide this in something else- though I really can\'t imagine what right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the cap was not on tightly when the package arrived and the black goo had leaked out into into the packaging.  They did have it wrapped securely in bubble wrap though, so it only got on that.  Still, not pleasant to have to clean the container before I could open it. I love the fact that this has so much iron in it.  I\'m a vegan and it\'s not easy to get enought iron.  The molasses isn\'t quite as tasty as some I\'ve had, but it has about 5 times more iron, so I\'m ok with it.  I don\'t think anyone would buy molasses online if they just wanted a tasty food, so I guess it\'s a winner. My cat suffers from bladder cysts frequently since i have used this now since november 2011 he has not had 1 attack of not being able to pass his urine. i place a few drops in his food every week. btw he does not like it but tolrates it. at first i had to use eye dropper and place a few drops in his mouth but after time he got used to it. a giant thank you this has saved me so much worry whether or not he will be ok. I bought this statehood gift basket to break apart the items into smaller gifts for friends/family.  It\'s over priced so I will not buy this again.  The contents are mainly food made in China,  like graham crackers and taffy etc. One of the reasons I wanted it was for the beautiful XL ceramic coffee mug in this set.  Basket/item  is really large due to all the fancy packaging like novelty wrapping/cardboard for bulk, so there is not that much in there.  It\'s fun to open and it will bring back memories of a state you resided in.  Overall I was delighted with it but not the outrageous price for China made items and some items listed in the product were NOT included in this particular gift.  ( items vary per set ) Wow, this tastes great, sweet and chocolaty! Like a liquid chocolate bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it is organic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does contain high-glycemic cane juice, so I don\'t drink too much. The original and vanilla flavors are sweetened with low-glycemic rice syrup. They have less sugar. All are organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\'t know why the ingredients here say canola oil. Neither the Good Karma website nor the label on the box has that ingredient. If I verified that this site is correct, and the Good Karma corporate website and the label on the carton are wrong, I would stop using the product. Perhaps this page has outdated ingredient information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the richest most milk-like rice beverage and the label on it does not mention canola oil, which contains up to 2% toxic erucic acid and is found in many rice beverages that are fed to children! Canola oil cannot be used by US FDA regulation in infant food. (One research paper found higher levels of erucic acid in red blood cells of autistic children compared to non-autistic children, and there are many other well established toxic effects of erucic acid in humans and animals. Look in the medical journals.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is sold in my neighborhood Ralph\'s (best price), VC discount, and Whole Foods in Los Angeles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 365 brand (Whole Foods own brand) is also canola-free. It is much cheaper but watery in comparison. I use it for cooking. Only plain and vanilla flavors, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;West Soy Rice beverage is also canola free. It has a more neutral taste and less body. They have a chocolate flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people find rice milk better tasting than other milk substitutes. I find it to be much easier to digest than soy and nut products. Soy milk, however, has much more protein. Aside from being hard to digest, I don\'t eat too much soy because of the anti-nutritional components; so I get my protein elsewhere. It is a tiny bit grainy .. but it doesn\'t bother me a bit, my kids really like it - I use this as a "chocolate syrup" substitute in my kids milk to make the box go further - they really love it - it\'s great drinking it full strength too.  Not too sweet.  We love it! I love this ricemilk.  It has the consistency of almond milk and no soy. I am a Saba fan.  It is expensive for this but the intensive flavor given to salad dressings, dips, etc is without equal.  Use your imagination for this fruity/astringent addition.  The only responsibily bad results is yours for poor execution. This is the second time that I ordered this product and I\'ve been very happy with it. Found these at a local grocery store and just about fell in love with them.  Their taste is fresher and most of the seeds live up to their name.  I got original, ranch and sizzlin bacon - they\'re all great!  When my grocery store told me they got Bigs as a one-time deal, I was happy to find them at Amazon.  If you\'re a seeder you\'ve gotta try these. The shipping was very prompt and the packaging excellent.  All other items in this order were excellent.  These were lollipops shaped and "painted" like flamingos.  But you have to hold them up close to the eye to figure out what they are!  They\'ll be "OK" to set out on the candy buffet, but they won\'t be the eye-catching item we\'d anticipated when we ordered. Licorice freakin rocks man, i like to take the licorice ropes and choke my self till im blue, then chew my way out. man this stuff is like crack, i just want roll it up and smoke it like a big fatty. Excited to have been able to find this candy as have been looking for ages. Was received very quickly and the candy was well packaged and fresh flavor.Will buy again. Thank you. I\'ve tried a bunch of them and the taste of this product is outstanding.  Even the folks behind the counter at my gym commented on it and they sell a competing product.  Give it a try, you won\'t be disappointed. It tastes delisious, and works efectively if yo drink it at the rigth time. Lean body is the suplement with the best flavor I\'ve ever tasted Great meal replacement drink that tastes great!  You get plenty of protein and other vital nutrients.  I prepare one of these whenever I\'m on the go and I won\'t have to worry about missing a meal.  The best bang for your buck, especially if you subscribe to the Amazon subscribe and save program. So I was doing my daily grocery shopping on Amazon and I was like awwww yeah there are some Rice Krispie treats sure can just make them in the kitchen but then you have to clean the spoon and wash the stove and then find some saran wrap in the kitchen to keep them more yummy for the next days....instead order these its simple a nice size treat that will give you plenty of treats for one day...high five to snap crackle and pop you guys rule. have a nice day k This product is perfect for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy. His stools are very regular and healthy. My Vet was very pleased to know I picked this product instead of a regular store brand. It\'s all natural and my puppy loves it. :) Flour type 00 is better than regular flour.  Whether frying it or baking it, dough maintains softness and pliability.&lt;br /&gt;I like it a lot. Bought four, 2 lb bags and use them to make bread and pizza dough. If you have fantacies of that perfect italian pizza you had  while touring through Italia, this flour is just the thing. The dough even smells slightly better, the final product produces the closest thing to that wonderful crust you can\'t find in the USA.  It\'s worth the dough, for the dough. This is the best flour for home made pizza. It has the best tasting crust I have found. It works best in a super hot oven if you don\'t have a pizza oven. I make a lot of bread.  My family\'s favorite is my focaccia.  I had been purchasing a very "well known" flour prior to trying this.  I am so happy I did try it.  I thought my italian breads could not get any better, but this bring it up a notch.  I am comparing this to all the other 00 flours.  If you are a bread maker I urge you to include in your next order. maria domenica I thought the whole figs would be softer for spreading but they are not. You have figs laying in a very sweet syrup. I\'ve only tried it on toast one time and it was way to sweet to eat. The figs just lay on top unspreadable. I would not buy again. Save your money. I have been to New Orleans at one of the Pat O Briens and had there hurricanes and this mix can taste just like what you would get at the restaurant.  The key is  that the mix  makes twice as much as it says it makes, so if you go by the directions it will takes powdery.  So either use half as much powder or twice as much water, mix with your favorite rum(what they use), vodka or gin and a nice sweet hurricane. This is the best quality Chamomile tea I have ever tried! This is only 1 oz. so it\'s a little pricey, but I will buy it again anyway, because the quality is out of this world. You will get three nice cups of tea out of one tablespoon, but the first one is the best, of course. I like mine strong. Chamomile fans will love this tea. chamomile tea is great with lemons and Apriva. chamomile tea is caffeine free that\'s great for pregnant women and those with high blood pressure. Love this coffee.  Have bought this flavor and several others in the past.  Recommend it to everyone.  Will continue to buy it as long as I can afford to.&lt;br /&gt;The French Vanilla is excellent as well! These are a great value, great size snack to have, or even share, great snack..... yummy.  Haven\'t tried other flavors, but just might have to. This hot sauce has an excellent taste, unlike most of Dave\'s Insanity sauces. I put 6-10 drops into a bowl of mild chili to make it hot. Like the other reviewer, I\'d put it at about 1 million SHUs. Having eaten fresh bhut jolokia (ghost) peppers which are supposed to be 1 million SHUs, I\'d compare it to those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 million SHUs would mean that the sauce is 25% pure capsaicin. That would make it prohibitively expensive to manufacture or consume. The first ingredient is vinegar. Anyone who uses hot sauce religiously should understand what that means. I read the other reviews and was expecting a hell of a lot more than what I got. It\'s got a good flavor to it, but it\'s just a few steps above tabasco. From what the other reviewers described, it seems this product has a LOT of variability in heat, which means it\'s going to have a lot of variability in quality. The bottle I got is really tame, far, far below my Dave\'s Ghost Pepper, Dave\'s Ultimate Insanity, Blair\'s After Death, Da Bomb Beyond Insanity, Da Bomb Ground Zero, Professor Phardtpounder\'s Colon Cleanser, it\'s a lacking sauce. Hell, Sriracha is hotter than this. If you get lucky and get a hot bottle, congrats. I use mine liberally on cheap pizza, because that\'s all it\'s good for. Reaaaly hot stuff. Way hotter than Dave\'s Ultimate Insanity. Rivaled only by some of Blair\'s sauces. I don\'t think it is 4 million Scoville though..Maybe 1 million. Listen if you want a good taste and hot. This the stuff! It won\'t melt your eyes out .but it is too hot to take straight . One dab will do ya on a bite of pizza! A friend brought over a bottle as a gift and I loved it enough to hop on and write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\'m just arm chairing this, but I\'d put it at somewhere in the range of 300K scovilles, or somewhere around half the heat of "Pure cap" or "Mad dog 357 with bullet". I tested the three side by side with a dab on the finger, dubious of the 4M claim. Maybe they mean it was made with 4 Million extract before diluted with the vinegar?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing with all those superhots is that after a point it really doesn\'t matter. They don\'t have flavor, and you can always just add in a few extra drops. (I still appreciate the novelty!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, it is aggressively priced, nice and hot, and unlike the other two sauces I\'ve mentioned, has a bit of flavor from the peppers and vinegar besides being simply being \'spicy oil\'. I like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is certainly going to become one of my regularly stocked hot sauces! It would go really well in a bit of soup, pasta, mashed potatoes, pizza, chicken wings, and so forth. this hot sauce is great im new to the extreme heat sauces but i have previously tried fear sauce which has 1,100,000 scoville units and this sauce is by far alot hotter just two drops mixed with a little salsa on my taco had my mouth on fire its unlikely 4,000,000 scoville probaly more like 2,000,000 but i would  recommend this product it is definatly not 4,000,000. half the heat of daves ghost sauce, maybe weaker. may be a good dipping sauce Not only does this sauce have a great taste. But they have a small enough pour spout on top to allow you to pour small drops on your food, if your careful, or pour a lot. It makes it easy to make something rather hot to, WheW,. What a heavy Burn ! I love this stuff. It\'s in a large 5 ounce bottle. And compared to sauces with less heat it has a great price. :) I have tried Daves Ghost Pepper hot sauce back to back with Z\'s, and Z\'s is considerably hotter. I don\'t know if someone got a bad batch, but it\'s painful to use more than a drop per square inch of food the first couple times you try it, nice to mix with something you want hot without a vinegary taste. Makes anything spicy without changing the flavor, but has a good flavor if you really go overboard with it. HAs a good taste it is a lil hott not 2 bad maybe just a lil less hotter than blaires ultra death sauces but has a better flavor really not much I can say abut this soup mix it taste great to us. we always bought the canned stuff when making pot roasts or whatever. then tried this well we will never go back to canned again. well worth the money will be buying more. These things are seriously beyond delicious!! Just the right touch of saltiness to go with the sweet. A perfect dessert or cheat snack for those long work days :) I had no idea something could taste this good. I\'m not really a caramel person, but if I had dreamed up the most perfect balance between sweet-salty-buttery richness it would be these Caramel Sea Salt Squares. I found them at Whole Foods and they are expensive, but worth every penny. Milk is the perfect compliment. Get some and you will not be disappointed. You may be ruined for chocolate brownies. Grilled out brats, chicken, and burgers for the entire family yesterday.  Covered all of it with Country Bob\'s seasoning and all purpose sauce!  The family loved it.  Best sauce available!!  Can\'t wait to use it on my steaks tonight! I am very happy with this tea.  I hesitated to order because of price but it comes in a nice tin with 50 round tea bags.  It is great tasting.  I add ginger chips to it and it really is great when I have an upset stomach.  I just recently received my second order. i got it for under 7 dollars shipped...  i wouldnt pay more than eight because your not getting much cereal. The company has been around for over 160 years, is the company that started PG Tips and started and owned Red Rose tea so you know you\'re dealing with a quality tea company. The flavor is very similar to PG Tips to me; but stronger. It\'s definitely a milk and sugar or honey tea due to it\'s strength and you\'ll be happy that the milk doesn\'t \'water it down\' in any way. With milk you\'ll still enjoy the full tea flavor; the milk only enhances the taste. It is a very strong tea, so be prepared for that. Otherwise it is a high quality, full flavored tea at an economical price. PG Tips is still my favorite but since I can\'t find it in my area but can find Brooke Bond Red Label at my local WalMart I\'m a convert due to the quality and the very similar flavor to PG Tips...maybe it\'s just me, but I taste the similarity.  You won\'t regret trying this tea! My brother Robert that he has purchased this exact product in this size from local Indian grocers in Houston TX and in Austin Tx area, including one purchase at a WalMart store in an area with significant Indian populations.  The tea was reported to be a wonderful product for iced tea with a faint pleasant flowery aftertaste.  He will purchase it again and again These David\'s Signature Beyond Gourmet "Bacon" jelly beans do indeed taste like a very sweet and smokey piece of bacon. This is not flavor that I\'m going to snack on, but would make a great gift for the many "bacon fanatics" out there. My wife commented that with a little vinegar flavor added in, they would taste like PA Dutch Bacon Dressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flavor is from David Klein, the creator of the famous "Jelly Belly" jelly beans, so I was thrilled to be offered this in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E"&gt;David\'s Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler&lt;/a&gt; to review since my family loves jelly beans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like that these jelly beans are made with natural flavors and colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH If you are the kind of guy who really enjoys a huge slab of bacon with your breakfast, not that wimpy kind of stuff they serve at a restaurant, but the kind that hunters grab when they are together, thick, with lots of fat in the middle, you WILL enjoy these! You can almost feel your cholesterol count go up as you bite into them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I must admit I am a wimpy, crispy kind of gal, and I like my bacon on the lean side, in fact with my allergies I have to use Morningstar Soy bacon (don\'t cringe!). So when I bit into these, I realized from the very first bite I was NOT their intended audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope, these are not "girl food." They are man food. If you want to carry a bag of these out to serve to your fishing or hunting buds early in the morning, this is the perfect selection for you. However, you might want to consider the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBLAMK"&gt;David\'s Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Man Mix&lt;/a&gt; for a selection, or the milder and tamer &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E"&gt;David\'s Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler&lt;/a&gt;. Both will give you a variety to try, just in case you don\'t like bacon as much as you think you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful to have received samples of all of these from the company to try, and am basing my review on the samples which they sent. (Oh, I passed the rest of my bacon ones on to my guy buddies). I bought two types of edible glitter to decorate a plain cake.  This one was by far the most stunning.  The other silver went on grey (not that appetizing) whereas this one had tonnes of sparkle and really made a statement.  Highly recommended.  Nice fast delivery too. I need every color that is available ! Love this product! ! Received shipment very fast! Very happy with this product, will buy more. I ordered this glitter based on the fact it advertised it was edible.  I wouldn\'t even try to feed this to anyone let alone on a cake for children!  I read several reviews and they all said how fantastic it was so I purchased on good faith.  When it arrived I wanted to see if it had a taste...it tastes like I assume craft glitter would taste.  I packaged it to send it back but didn\'t. If you want a trust worthy edible glitter, stick with Wilton products. This stuff worked out great for my Disco Ball Birthday Cake.  My customer loved it! Check it out [...]&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a great way to add that little extra something for your treats, you found it. I used this product on a cake topper for a wedding cake that I made. It worked out so well. Bride &amp; groom were very happy and got non-stop compliments!! Simply wonderful! It adds that last little bit of WOW to your cake creations. I will be back for more! Totally amazed at how far a small amount of this glitter can be spread. I bought 3 to decorate a wedding cake &amp; used less than 1/2 of one! It was beautiful &amp; worth the money. This is a very tasty product.  This is my first time trying this, and I am glad I ordered it to see how it tastes.  As a product I\'d order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One odd thing though that will cause me to lower this rating from 5 stars to 4 is that the listing here says a pound, but on the label 16 ounces is crossed out and 14 ounces is written next to it.  I didn\'t weigh the container to confirm this, but if it is 14 ounces, then then they need to update their listing to show such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I consider shipping to not be part of a product review I won\'t lower my star rating for this, and consider this to be just a mention of this then but the shipping was SLOW.  I ordered it on June 20th.  A USPS tracking/delivery confirmation number was generated on the 21st to be fair, but it took until July 5th for me to get this.  Even taking into account that there was a major holiday July 4th, that just seems too slow.  Everything was packaged well enough (although without anything like a "blue ice" pack to keep it cold for summer shipping...) but just took a long time to get here.  I do suspect the order wasn\'t truly shipped until the week before the July 4th weekend, despite a tracking number being generated on June 21st. This was a gift from my Lil Sis.  Awesome.  Great flavor.  Can taste berries and rhubarb.  I love it.  Most likely will order more. If I could give this food a zero I would. I tried it out and the dogs loved it until they all had the runs for 2 days. It was horrible, smelled bad, and I would never get it again! Vimto, love it. Fekkin expensive here though!&lt;br /&gt;That\'s the problem with no longer living back in Blighty, stuff like Vimto becomes much more difficult to get. It\'s true you also need a decent scale (I used &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OKR89G"&gt;Jennings CJ300 300g X 0.1g Scale&lt;/a&gt;).  I tried the Caviar Cointreau recipe [...] and everything worked perfectly on the first try (it\'s fast too - under 20 minutes &amp; I\'m sure faster once you get the hang of it).  It\'s fun &amp; very easy to make (a juice recipe would be a really fun way to do an edible chemistry experiment with kids).  The kit comes with large enough samples that it looks like it\'ll be good for 40+ uses. I bought the kit to dabble in spherification. The item is as-described and arrived on time. My complaint is that the instructions measure the required chemicals in fractions of grams. My kitchen scale measures as low as 1 gram but does not do fractions of grams. I cannot find a kitchen scale that measures fractions of grams. Therefore I find the kit difficult to use. I would not recommend the kit because it requires the purchase of specialized scale that can measure tenths of grams. Soon after one dog was diagnosed with renal failure (Yes, she ate all the foods on that recall list), my Westie became ill and couldn\'t hold any food. The vet did all sorts of tests, but I had to find something gentle enough for him to keep down. That night I met a rep from Nutro at my local Petco. She told me all about Natural Choice, gave me literature and a website to learn more. I purchased this canned food along with a small bag of the dry food to mix with it. Turns out the dog had some sort of virus, but the food was the only food he could keep down to regain his strength. Due to skin allergies known to Westies, I have kept him on this food and find it\'s the best for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don\'t understand, though, how this is sold so cheap on Amazon thru Petco. It\'s $16.99/case in the store and $15.99 on their website.  I think they should keep the price regulated throughout. Not much of a lemon flavor for lemon cookies, more on the sweet side.  Coconut is listed in the ingredients, but you certainly won\'t taste it.  My son liked them, so they won\'t go to waste.  I would not buy them again. Now I know this formulation is not the most natural or high grade one on the market right now. Believe me, I have tried to get her interested in just about every brand with the word "natural" in the title, and she is not having it. She won\'t get the benefit of the food if she won\'t eat it. So when I noticed she was eating all of her food when I put this in front of her, I decided to stick with what is apparently working. This is still premium food, formulated for my twelve year-old\'s needs, and she really, really likes it. \'Nuff said. These are perfect if you want to add some beans to another soup, or just to have any size portion of black beans right away. As they are dried, they last forever, and you can have any portion size you want. With a little water and microwave, they perk up to give you really good quality black beans. I like these better than canned black beans, and I don\'t have any more at any time than I want. Adding them to soups which are too watery is a great way to thicken them up. You can\'t do that with canned beans which are mostly water in the first place. I haven\'t calculated the price out, but these are probably not any more expensive than canned beans because you aren\'t buying any water. Would be perfect for camping food as well. I was born and raised on the east coast  Trenton - New Jersey ). I have loved Tasty-Kakes my whole life , so its a great present to find some mew flavors or twists on old familiar receipes. I got this product for my husband beause he loves Dr Pepper. It came before the date it was suppose to arrive on. He loves it he wants to drink it but he doesnt, he is keeping it as a collertors item beause they dont make them anymore. The item was packed good and safe and everything was there. NO COMPLAINTS! Shipping was quite a bit but the bottles were all unbroken and in good shape. Since Dublin no longer makes D.P. I wanted some bottles for a keep sake. These meet the bill. Over all good experience. This is the new "Dublin" dr pepper now bottled in Temple Texas.  This is produced after Dr. Pepper force Dublin out of production.  It is not the same as Dublin Dr. Pepper, that is why it is so cheap.  If you want the real thing, you\'ll pay more for it. ESPECIALLY AS WE GET OLDER, THE LINING OF OUR STOMACH GETS MORE SENSITIVE TO HARSH CHEMICALS AND SUBSTANCES.  LOW ACID COFFEE IS A COMMON SENSE SUBSTITUTE THAT LOSES NO AROMA OR TASTE IN THE PROCESS.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I received my 2 cases of Rice Works and the chips are awesome tasting and a great price BUT in every single bag (24) the chips were crunched/smashed into little pieces so i guess I have 24 bags of salad toppers or ..... but not chips. I was delighted to find this product online, because I cannot always find it in the stores.  However, each package I have opened thus far is at least half reduced to crumbs because of poor packaging for shipping.  I doubt that I will order more using this method. These chips are some of the best I\'ve had--ever! They\'re so good I dare say that they\'re addictive from the very first time you try a few. The taste of the salsa is delicious and the fresh chips go with lots of other foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main ingredient is whole grain brown rice; and yes, this is good for you. I haven\'t had regular potato chips in quite a while; but I would imagine that these chips have less fat then potato chips have. There are no trans fats, no cholesterol, no preservatives, no and artificial flavors. They are even wheat and gluten free! Very good! They have less than 1 gram of sugar per serving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do have some sodium; they have about 200mg of sodium in every serving; and there are roughly five servings to a bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have further questions, the company maintains a website and an email address so you can contact them. Good PR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these are some very awesome chips! I highly recommend them. Enjoy! I tried these chips on a whim while shopping at COSTCO. They stopped carrying the chips and I had to look elsewhere for these delicious snacks. No local store carried them, so I turned to Amazon.com in hopes of finding them. As soon as I discovered them on the list of foods carried by Amazon, I ordered a box.&lt;br /&gt;When the box of chips arrived, I opened a bag of the  Riceworks Salasa Fresca chips, only to find not a single whole chip. The largest chip was no more than a quarter the size of a whole chip. It was impossible to use them to dip with. I hoped that was just an isolated bag of the product, but, most of the bags had similarly damaged chips. On average there were only a couple of whole chips to each bag.&lt;br /&gt;It was very disappointing to have a great slasa style chip reduced to rubble during shipping. Because of the condition of the chips upon arrival, I will not buy them from Amazon.com again.&lt;br /&gt;Great Chips when they are whole. A great disappointment when they are reduced to crumbled pieces. I have tried all of the RICEWORKS chips except for the sesame soy which i plan to try soon i have a un-opened bag still so far prefer the sweet chile chips. These chips are pretty healthy as far as chips go made from brown rice and pop when chewed on. I bought them @Top Food\'s here in WASHINGTON State Costco has the larger 16oz BAG in the sweet chile flavor only. Price was $2.99 at Top Foods for 5.5oz size $2.88 on Amazon for same size.&lt;br /&gt;Costco was $4.99 for the 16oz size... These are the best tasting chips ever !  I can\'t get them anywhere here in Denver area so went to the internet to find them.  Wouldn\'t you know Amazon came thru !  Only concern is that they arrive a little crumbled---I guess understandable considering they\'re being shipped.  However, not so in store, when I could still get them here.  Really grateful that I can get them at all. The chips are awesome.  I first bought them at Costco and now I cannot get them there any more.  The bags at Costco were about 3 times larger than the one I recieved from Amazon.  The arrived mostly in tiny crumbles of chips and the bags were about 1/3 full.  I won\'t waste my money buying them from Amazon again as the shipping is just not up to par.  If you can find the chips retail I would advise buying them that way.  Their website says that super target and Costco carries them but have not been able to find them there recently. I am constantly looking for gluten free foods that I might enjoy for health reasons, I was excited to see these in my local store. Not only need you be concerned just with the MSG and soy protein, be aware of the weight in the packages. The bags purchased stated 5.5 oz. One seemed to be much lighter than the other. When I got them home, I put them in zip lock bags to check the contents. The bag that had seemed very light compared to the others was indeed less than a third of the amount in the other bags. It was no more than a very small handful. It did not contain crushed or broken chips, it contained very few chips. This is not the time for corporations who want to succeed and grow to cheat consumers! Is this a growing trend? I find it so. LOVE these chips.  I think there are so many GF baked goods (be they less than exciting rice chips, heavy breads, grainy cakes, etc.) that just fall short of taste and texture.  I am knocked out by how crisp and tasty these are!  They are much like a popular orange triangular chip but better, even "fresher" tasting.  If I don\'t take a serving and put the bag away first, I\'m very likely to mow through it in one sitting.  Products like these make me feel like I\'m not sacrificing anything at all for the sake of going GF. I LOVE these chips.  They are addictive...it\'s hard to just eat a few.  I tried the Chili flavor that has great reviews and I don\'t think they compare to the Salsa Fresca.  If you like a chip with a little kick...these are perfect. The chips are delicious!! I absolutely love them. They are very addicting. Excellent for people with gluten/wheat allergies. The only thing was that during the shipping process the chips became broken and crumbled, not as bad as I thought after reading other reviews but still quite a few crumbs in the bottom of the bags. I would order again. These are great chips.  I have tried both the Salsa Fresca and Sweet Chili and love them both (if I had to choose one over the other would take the Salsa Fresca - just my personal preference).  Will be trying the Sea Salt in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can\'t go wrong with these chips! These things are like eating poker chips with seasoning salt.  They\'re remarkably high in calories, too! I make for my wife capuccinno in the mourning befor she goes to work.&lt;br /&gt;And I use flavored coffee in the esspreso machine and it is hard to find&lt;br /&gt;Hazelnut flavored ground coffee at a reasonable price or finding just flavored&lt;br /&gt;beans. This 5pound bag from Coffee Bean Direct was an excellent price and&lt;br /&gt;the flavor was very good also. A great choice for paople who grind their&lt;br /&gt;own coffee beans. This coffee tastes like a good cityroast coffee with a mild hazelnut flavor.  It\'s good.  I am a big fan of hazelnut, and I would like the flavor to be a little stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves the aroma of this one and he prefers it to the Boyer Hazelnut because it is a little darker roast than the Boyer. Smells great, looks great and tastes great.  As a guy who likes strong espresso type coffee, I was surprised and impressed by the bold flavor with just a hint of Hazelnut.  With just a little half and half its great first thing in the morning. My husband loves Hazelnut coffee but the price of flavored coffee is so high, I used to only give it to him once a week, but now I can afford to give him his favorite everyday! He loves the rich flavor! I have been buying this coffee for at least 3 years and I love it. Smooth taste with a hint of hazelnut. Friends enjoy coming over just for a good cup of coffee. This is a nice "middle." It\'s a good-tasting roast coffee, with some hazelnut flavor. I\'d say it is as good or better than the Wal-Mart Millstone hazelnut coffee. More of the hazelnut flavor is often too much for moi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\'s not the best coffee I ever had, but it\'s just fine considering that it only costs about $6.25 / lb in the current market (Millstone is about $9).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is what the product is -- 5 lbs. It\'s hard to keep that amount fresh, unless you are a restaurant. When a package is opened, I package the full 5 lbs in Wal-Mart (...) coffee bags, 1/2 lb per bag, then double-bag it into freezer bags, and pop that into the freezer. That way it stays fairly fresh, as defined by the aroma -- which is really nice when fresh, and less so when not Trying something new with this coffee. Didn\'t blow me away but for the price, it\'s excellent. I don\'t have anything bad to say about it other than it\'s a BIG bag and I am mildly concerned with freshness toward the end, but we burn thru beans pretty fast =D I have been so called a hazelnut coffee freak for about 10 years and I have to say that I finaly found the match to the hazelnut coffee my father in law offered me whenever I was over visiting. He has passed away so I can not say if it was from Coffee Bean Direct. But darn it. It sure taste just like what he brewed up. Thanks you for the good cup of coffee and at a reasonable price. I got this page book marked for later orders. TLA This coffee is good. I have tried a lot of hazelnut coffees and this is one of the best I got from amazon. It has a darker and richer flavor than most hazelnut coffee. It was fresh and tasty and the price was great at about $6 per pound with subscribe and save. I will order it again Finally, an affordable flavored coffee worth drinking.&lt;br /&gt;Coffee Bean Direct Hazelnut is a really smooth, medium roast coffee with a definite hazelnut flavor.&lt;br /&gt;The flavoring is not sweetened, which is a real plus, especially if you don\'t like sweeteners in your coffee. (If you do, you have complete control yourself.)&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is not overpowering, but is enough to let you know you are drinking a hazelnut coffee.&lt;br /&gt;Those who have complained may have received a bad batch. Usually the blend is good and roasting consistant, but, as with any other food product, variations and accidents do happen.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Coffee Bean Direct coffee for about five years and have not yet received a bad batch.&lt;br /&gt;This one is a winner. Since Folgers discontinued their Hazelnut I have tried atleast 10 different brands.. FINALLY THE BEST....This coffee is the best Hazelnut Whole bean we have found in years. Love the taste, the Smoothness,,,IT IS WONDERFUL..Finally AMAZON found a good one....We put this on REGULAR SHIPMENTS DO NOT WANT TO LOSE THEM... Thrilled with the taste.  THANK YOU AMAZON....Tried so  many my Husband and I love it and will follow them where ever they will go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MJ Wood&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of Amazon and it\'s FAST SHIPPING and REGULAR MONTHLY PROGRAM WE WILL BUY MORE GROCERY PRODUCTS FROM THEM.  IT IS EASY, FAST AND CHEAPER THAN THE STORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now looking for more products that save us a trip to the store...THANK YOU AMAZON you make it easier for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember years ago when my Grandmother would call the Grocery store give them a list and they delivered it to her home...NOW I HAVE AMAZON to help us in our SENIOR YEARS.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PROGRAM FOR SENIORS OR BUSY PEOPLE.  RELIABLE, MONEY SAVING and great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Problem I had was with Chrystal Light i ordered was hard as a rock like it had been in warehouse for years.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MJ WOOD Before I say anything else, I am mindful of differing tastes, as well as differences in processing from one batch of coffee to another. That said, I found the Coffee Bean Direct Hazelnut coffee to be evenly roasted (medium) and bearing a robust and rich hazelnut flavor from the first to the last cup. Since this is my first bag of hazelnut coffee from CBD, with which I am very pleased, I will update my comments, specifically addressing the consistency of the roasting/flavoring process from batch to batch with my next purchase. If my other CBD purchases are any indication, I anticipate a consistent product. The only other flavored coffee I\'ve used was Nestle Hazelnut. It too was a 5# whole bean.  I really enjoyed that one and thought I pick this one up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the Nestle\'s shared flavor with the bean this one overpowers.  This one has a burnt note that seems flavoring instead of roast related. I like hazelnuts and this a isn\'t anything like hazelnut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have 5# of the stuff.  My mistake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More Info:&lt;br /&gt;I am about 3/4 of the way through the bag.  My opinion has not changed.  Also, I would note a very inconsistent flavor.  Today\'s grind seems almost devoid of the flavoring.  It appears they really don\'t have the adding of flavoring down.  The intensity of the flavoring is all over the park. This is not a deeply roasted or rich tasting coffee at all.  It\'s very light, with unevenly sized beans -- clearly a blend.  Some beans are normal size and some are tiny.  The hazelnut aroma and flavor is good, but this coffee is not strong at all -- even using twice as many grounds, I could not get enough coffee flavor from these beans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who like very weak coffee will probably love this.  People who like Starbucks will not like this one bit. Anyone who knows Yaucono will like the "new" packaging of mylar-laminated plastic.  I wonder how long they packaged in layers of paper?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not had this very rich Puerto Rican coffee, you must sample it and then buy in bulk.  Juan Valdez might have a good bean, but the Puerto Ricans do it better. I love this coffee. I tried it in Puerto Rico on our honeymoon and am hooked! I may even go back to Puerto Rico and get more! This is a hefty roll of mylar! The 50" width allows more coverage, obviously, but the 1 ml thickness is what\'s really nice.  It\'s not flimsy! This cake always turns out consistently sweet and moist, but bland.  Compared to the new deluxe Duncan Hines version of German Chocolate cake, this is not impressive.  It will do when you\'re craving something different from regular chocolate cake, though. This Creme Brulee is as good as any homemade! Why bother with homemade when you can get just as delicious from a box! Easier to make too! Oetker products are always the best. I\'ve used them for years because they have unique items that are tasty and easy to prepare. You absolutly cannot go wrong with this Creme Brulee. Why spend a ton of money at a restaurant when you can serve it by candlelight at home? This Creme Brulee is better than some of the better French restaurants I\'ve been to. I just wish my local grocery stores would carry it! It tastes like Jack Links brand, not Wild Bill\'s.  Even the texture is totally different from Wild Bill\'s.  Not recommended! I blame myself for trying to save a buck - this coffee is way too weak for my tastebuds - they say it\'s a dark blend but it\'s not even close to a dark roast I buy at stores.  In the end, I have blend each can with a pound of dark roast and it\'s OK. If you like a rich dark coffee, this product is NOT for you!  We\'d been looking for an organic alternative, and I\'ve tried some great ones, so we ordered this when it was on special.  Unfortunately, we ordered 6 cans to get the discount, and now we are stuck with organic, but very dull tasting coffee.  To make the best of it, we\'ve bought other tried and true rich dark brands to mix with it.  Very disappointing! I bought this along with the regular dark roast at a considerable discounted price.  Well lets just say you get what you pay for.  The flavor really is not there and this as well is not much of a dark roast. We use this coffee at my office. People like it a lot and I feel good about it being organic and fair trade. Organic, fair trade, Cafe Altura Coffee brews a great pot of coffee. \'Organic\' makes it healthy, and \'fair trade\' makes it a responsible choice. The Dark Blend is a flavorful choice. I prefer rich, strong coffee and this product is a bit bland for my taste We like dark roast coffee because it has more body and tastes stronger.  This coffee is just that!  It\'s great that it\'s both organic and fair trade.  The 3-pack means you have coffee for a while, and the price is very good.  You can either recycle the can, or repurpose it around the house.  All-in-all, a very good deal! Nice body and full roasted flavor at a reasonable price for a organic "fair trade".  I\'d buy the discounted pack again, but full price cost it too much to overcome my desire for an affordable coffee. I ordered this for my Mother-in-law who could not find this product anywhere near where she lives.  She is really enjoying this product. Very fresh and tasty SOFT buns that go well with my Omaha steak burger patties.&lt;br /&gt;They store well. Chewy Lemonhead and Friends are my favorite candy. Period. I love them...so much.&lt;br /&gt;...(cough)&lt;br /&gt;So when I found these I was really excited and bought a pack hoping they\'d have that same tartness that makes Lemonhead and Friends so good!&lt;br /&gt;Nope. Tasted just like every other jelly-gummy type candy. I was very let down. It was okay for jelly/gummy, but don\'t expect much. I haven\'t ordered this item YET, so I can\'t speak to the customer service angle.  However, I have purchased this product at a local specialty food store that sadly no longer carries it and I must say it\'s one of the five greatest things I have ever put in my mouth.  It\'s so great I have literally eaten it straight from the jar! If you\'ve never had lingonberries, they are crimson red, roughly the sized of blueberries, and taste a lot like sweetened cranberries, only better.  They don\'t have the acrid taste that cranberries sometimes have, but I will say that if you dislike cranberries, this may not be your favorite thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the lingonberry products I\'ve tried - jams and preserves - the Fellix Preserves are my very favorite.  The berries are whole or in halves, the color is true and the fluid part is completely smooth, rich and has a dense texture.  The flavor is strong enough to stand up to the density and full flavor of a biscuit, but it\'s also great on bagels or english muffins or toast.  And although I haven\'t tried doing it, I\'ve heard this is a great product to use in baking - this would be great in a berry muffin, or as a complement to game dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this! All of my family members are fans of fruit jams, jellies, and preserves because they are versatile food products that any person of any age can consume. These food products are also friendly for people with TMJ/jaw problems as well. When I tried Hafi\'s Cloudberries Preserves from Sweden, I decided to try Felix\'s Lingonberries Preserves, too. Like the other Amazon reviewer said, if you like the taste of cranberries, then you\'ll probably like this lingonberries preserve. This lingonberries jam has berries in it and looks beautiful as you spread the preserves on pancakes and soft bread. It\'s the color red, and kind of reminds me of cranberries, the taste and look of them, especially cranberry dressing and salads during American Thanksgiving meals. Swedish lingonberries are very sweet and tart. My recommendation is to buy both Hafi\'s Cloudberry Preserves and Felix\'s Lingonberries Preserves for your household and when you\'re entertaining guests. Why? - because each person has different tastes, and Swedish cloudberry preserves is more mild with less tartness, and would accomodate the people who wouldn\'t appreciate the tartness of Swedish lingonberries. If you have both Swedish cloudberry and Swedish lingonberry preserves, then you would cover all your bases in terms of pleasing every family member and guest. When it comes to eating this jam straight from the spoon, personally for me, it is really tart, tangy, and a little strong. While with cloudberry preserves, I could probably eat the whole jar without tasting or sensing a strong tartness. Personally for me, this lingonberries preserves tastes great with vanilla yogurt; it reminds me of Yoplait\'s fruit in the bottom yogurts. According to Felix, on their jar, they say that these lingonberries ripen during summertime in northern Sweden. The ingredients in these preserves are: wild lingonberries, sugar, and fruit pectin. Felix also suggest putting these preserves on meat. I ordered these jars from the seller on Amazon, and they did a good job wrapping and taping bubble wrap to protect each jar from breaking during transport. Anyways, I highly recommend trying Swedish lingonberries and Swedish cloudberries preserves. Both of these Swedish treats offer different tastes that are yummy and good! very excelent quality preserve lingonberry,,i will order it again,,but the shipment pack should be covered better with strong materials,,thank u for the great felix lingonberry I can\'t imagine why but it seems that grocery stores have stopped stocking this item. If you haven\'t tried it you must, it is the best coating mix available and my family keeps asking me to make chicken only with this shake and bake. It has a very different flavor than any BBQ sauce on the market, a flavor all it\'s own that is really delicious and goes with any side dish. I have made stuffing, mashed potatoes (a favorite) and almost any vegetable to go with it and everyone always has a second helping of chicken.It\'s perfect for company because it is unique and tastes like something you would cook for a special occasion. I am always afraid that they will stop making it, it really has become a staple in our home and even the most finicky people love it, kids all seem to love it and I love it because it is quick and easy. It\'s a very unique flavor, I want to say a little sweeter than most BBQ sauces or flavorings but not really sweet , kind of like a honey BBQ but better, that can be used on pork chops as well. There is a plastic bag enclosed to shake it in but I find that more of the mix sticks to the sides and it is very hard to coat the chicken , a lot of wasted mix that way. I put it on a plate a little at a time and add as needed, then I rinse the chicken pieces and kind of lightly roll them on the plate in the coating (shaking a little out of the packet on spots that are not coated) and then place them into a baking pan that I line with foil, it makes clean up much easier after cooking, almost don\'t need to wash the pan this way.Try to get all the pieces covered especially on the tops because the bottom will come off a little bit from the grease that cooks out of the chicken. Any mix left in the packet I shake on pieces that don\'t look completely covered and then just on top of all of them. I usually get a package of about 3 or 4 half breasts and a package of 6 thighs and one pack of mix will cover it all if you roll it on a plate. It becomes very sticky when it gets wet so it will stick to the plate, your fingers and of course the chicken pieces. I have also used a little bit of plum jam brushed on the chicken before coating it and thats very good too, but honestly you don\'t need to add anything it is delicious the way it is. Cook it long enough to get browned and crispy and remove it to a serving dish right away so it doesn\'t sit in the grease and you will be extremely happy with the results. I would really be interested to hear from someone who has never cooked with this before and see what they think. Have you ever try bbq chicken wings?&lt;br /&gt;Use this glase and it would be delicious.&lt;br /&gt;I used it a lot but usually bought it in super market. today I didn\'t find it there so I came online and order more here price is much better here. For some reason they stopped selling this in stores in Fort Worth.  This is my favorite for chicken. I HAD USED AND COME TO LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND SUDDENLY COULD NOT FIND IT IN STORES NEAR ME. I CAME TO AMAZON AND THERE IT WAS! I COULD NOT GET MY CARD OUT QUICK ENOUGH! I SHARE WITH MY DAUGHTER WHO ALSO CAN\'T FIND THIS ITEM LOCALLY.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS AMAZON!!!! This is the best coating/glaze to help make BBQ Chicken. I never can find it is the stores so I always buy it here and it is so much cheaper then a store. I pour it in a pie pan roll the chicken in it then bake. After I roll all the chicken I put the remaining glaze in a Zip Lock gallon bag and place in the freezer till the next time. Sometimes I mix the glaze with plain Chicken Shake n Bake for a crunchy BBQ coating. This BBQ Glaze Shake\'N\'Bake is great for other meats besides chicken and pork.&lt;br /&gt;They made great Christmas gifts for grandchildren in college. We live in Tucson AZ and all of a sudden we can\'t find this one product anywhere in Tucson. I makes the chicken so juicy and tender and the flavor is beyond compare. So happy to be able to purchase some and looking forward to buying more!!!! They stopped selling this at Walmart which made me sad but then I found it on amazon which made me glad. You have to buy in bulk but (going by the ones that I received) they don\'t expire for over a year so as long as you store it correctly you should be able to buy in bulk even if it\'s a small household like mine. this item is so hard to find. i was so thrilled to find i could buy more than just one at a time. Delicious, easy and quick!  Kraft Shake \'N Bake BBQ Glaze for chicken and pork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kraft BBQ Shake \'N Bake is a great option to "traditional" BBQ recipes and brimming with flavor.  Perfect for company, everyday family meals, or a solitudinarian.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May I suggest:  BBQ Shake \'N Bake chicken, cream potatoes, steamed broccoli, and a lettuce wedge salad.  You\'ll have a great meal in under an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZYN4O"&gt;Kraft Shake \'N Bake Seasoned Coating Mix Barbecue Glaze 2 Pack with Shaker Bag - 8 Pack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it now  :) I had not been able to find Kraft Shake \'n Bake at the two (2)grocery stores where I shop.I was so glad to find this product available through Amazon.com. It was easy to order and was delivered very quickly. Great service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Laura W.&lt;br /&gt;Phoenix AZ For whatever reason the only 2 grocery stores where I live no longer carry this product. It is my husbands absolute favorite. I am so glad I am still able to buy this product on line. I remember the old days of having shake and bake BBQ ( I had a mother that was raising 5 girls alone). Chicken and the S &amp; B were cheap to buy in these days and we ate it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought those memories could be recreated through smell and taste again, but oh My godness it was!!&lt;br /&gt;It is just a delicious as I remember it being as a kid. I bought a case of 8 and have 6 more left. I don\'t know why the stores don\'t have this in stock...one clerk said its the msg in it. Well people should be able to make there choices of buying it or not buying it.&lt;br /&gt;I am still amazed at the granular style it is and how it ends up this red sticky delicious old style bbq sauce that sticks to it like glue.&lt;br /&gt;It is so gooood!! I highly recommend buying it and it would probably be good on ribs too!!&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVW0"&gt;Shake \'N Bake Seasoned Coating Mix, BBQ Glaze, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)&lt;/a&gt; Welcome to heaven, Judy.&lt;br /&gt;What?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you have arrived.&lt;br /&gt;What?&lt;br /&gt;You are asleep now, thanks to Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime tea.&lt;br /&gt;But I don\'t remember going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;My point exactly. That\'s why I call it heaven.&lt;br /&gt;But who are you?&lt;br /&gt;I am Sleepytime Judy and I am asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What welcome relief, knowing there is a pleasant, calming antidote to the stresses of a relentlessly busy mind that sometimes refuses to shut down. Just walk to the kitchen, put the kettle on, pull out a Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime teabag, place in a favorite cup--mine is a slender version of a Blue Willow cup, pour on water at just the boiling point, and wait for the tea to steep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, pick up the box--how many times now--and read the the words.&lt;br /&gt;"100% Natural Herb Tea, Caffeine Free."&lt;br /&gt;"a comforting blend of chamomile and spearmint creates a lullaby of tender flavor to soothe your senses..."&lt;br /&gt;"...it lets you curl up under a quilt of flavor and quiet the tensions of your world..."&lt;br /&gt;\'The sweetest way I think of you is when the day is done.\' Emily Dickinson&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Chamomile, spearmint, lemon grass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorn berries, and rosebuds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before I take my cup back to bed, I look at the last panel of the box. There\'s papa bear asleep in his cozy chair in front of the fire, Mama is carrying the baby and holding the hand of another, taking them to bed. Through an open door one can see two little bears already asleep in their bed. All in all, a cozy room of happiness and warmth and the promise of sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sip my cup of Sleepytime tea quickly, almost gulping. I have learned that if I sip my usual slow sipping, I will fall asleep only halfway finished. That is how efficacious the tea... really... is..... Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality. The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach. Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds. The healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect. Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds. Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache. Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don\'t package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quote from the box:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or friendship, is conversation." Oscar Wilde. Tea has a great flavor - almost what I\'d call \'spearmint\' flavor which is great with honey or sugar with or without cream. I drink it hot and if it does cool, it\'s still good.  It does help me relax and go to sleep when I\'ve had a long day.  My grandchildren love the flavor and we often share a pot of tea as it is perfectly safe for them.  Celestial Seasoning Teas are great teas always but Sleepytime is one of their classics! I\'d recommend this tea to anyone, as out of all of Celestial Seasonings teas, this is probably ranks as close to number one on my list of favorites.  And I do have a lot of their tea in my pantry -- my son swears I must own stock in it, LOL.  If you like tea, try it, I really think you\'ll be glad you did as I feel Sleepytime truly is one of their best teas. :) at it\'s best.  I have been drinking this tea since high school and the flavor has not wavered.  I\'ve tried plain chamomile and it didn\'t make the cut. Nothing beats a cup or two of Sleepy Time before bed as it calms the nerves and settles the tummy.  What a perfect way to drift off into slumber ! Just 1 cup in the evening caps off my day and gets me relaxed and is a permanent part of my bedtime prep.  This CS Sleepytime Tea is my absolute FAVORITE evening tea ritual!  I think it is the wonderful flavor of camomile plus the spearmint that adds that extra something refreshing...ahhhh...(sigh)...big yawn...I\'m toddling off to sleep now........  P.S.  I also love a cup anytime I\'m feeling somewhat stressed and especially whenever I need to wind down like after a long time on the computer or after stressful shopping trips.  Take a cup and you\'ll really be in a mellow place. Tea\'s are very personal and everyone has their favorites. I really enjoy this tea when relaxing, or before bed. The subtle mint flavor seems to comfort and sooth. A little sugar (I\'m not a fan of honey) really makes all the flavors POP! Being a fan of this tea it was a no brainer to order it in bulk, the price at the time was great, cheaper then the grocery store (by far). The packaging was efficient and made it really easy to store. I love Sleepytime tea at night while I\'m laying in bed reading a book, winding down for sleep. It has a fresh, comforting flavor, and a really great scent. It is a main part of my relaxing bedtime ritual, and I make use of Amazon\'s automatic re-ordering program, which saves me So Much money compared to grocery store prices. I only gave 4 stars because after about a week of drinking it every night it kind of loses it\'s charm. That\'s when I alternate it with Celestial\'s Tension Tamer, just to keep things interesting. Great product for herbal tea lovers, and again, a much better price here than in the grocery stores. I love Sleepy Time tea, I used to give it to my children, since it is caffeine free, as they grew up, it helped them warm up and fall asleep quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a little story and a small cup of warm tea, that was the routine especially in the winter. They are all grown now but I find that they are now serving it to my grand children and it is having the save effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still drink it between all the other teas I enjoy but this one is just a little more special. We make most of our tea from loose leaf in a press pot. Sleepytime is the lone exception. We\'ve been drinking this tea for many years now and it still rates among our very favorites. It\'s the perfect blend of camomile and mint. And you gotta love the bear. Have used this herbal tea for sometime now...one cup before bedtime and it always helps me rest better.  Love the discount for ordering the six months supply. I have been purchasing and drinking this tea for years.In fact since Mo Siegel used to advertise it on TV..now that is a long time ago. It really helps calm frazzled adults as well as hyper children before bed. But what is more share worthy is the fact that it is a great tea for children that suffer from motion sickness.&lt;br /&gt; Our oldest daughter used to be car sick all the time. We carried an endless supply of "baggies" for her as she would 8 out of 10 times relieve herself when commuting back and forth to school.&lt;br /&gt; We discovered that this tea, given 20 minutes before the ride and every hour or so on long family trips curtailed her horrid events completely. The main ingredient is chamomile and it really helps relieve motion sickness and soothe frazzled nerves. when ordering in bulk with the repeat shipping option, this tasty tea is a great value Sleepytime tea is one of those teas that can always be counted on. It\'s very mellow, with a great taste and smell. Perfect for relaxing after a long day. This is the tea that all other herbal teas should be measured against. Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams. This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night\'s sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect. Valerian is a very effective herb if you can\'t get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won\'t feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review What a wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;I can drink it all times of the day, so obviously the original Sleepytime Tea causes no real drowsiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start my day with the tea and end it with the tea.&lt;br /&gt;It makes me so relaxed and it\'s healthier then smoking..lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\'s also made me a fan of sugarless tea.&lt;br /&gt;Never again will I go back to sweet tea or terriable diet sodas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try some Sleepytime Tea if you love tea! The flavor is amazing and very smooth as well as unique. It\'s great hot or cold!&lt;br /&gt;You will not be dissappointed. This product is so great.  My daughter who is extremely pick loves it and she is also gluten free!!  so she can actually have this!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Not bad for 100 calories per serving!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This will be a great dish to take for Thanksgiving dinner. I like to make this when I make chicken fajitas or dirty rice, it is a nice compliment and does not dry out as much as Jiffy\'s corn muffin mix (which I used to use). This packet, water, half a stick of butter and a can of creamed corn is all it takes, then bake for 45 minutes. It is moist and sweet, it does not last long in my house! Easy and delicious!  Have made it in a 9x5" loaf pan as well as in a mini-muffin pan;  both methods yield a great-tasting product. I make this product when we have any kind of Tex-Mex meal.  Everyone loves it.  It is easy to make and tastes great. Seems stange that any item this good and tasty would disappear from stock iun the stores.  So glad  to find it on Amazon...and at the rate we eat this - especially in the winter with chili, won\'t have any problem going thru the bulk order of 12 pkgs...&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon and Chi-Chi\'s! I had a taco party and almsot every single guest asked me How do I make the Corncake?.  I run out every year. This little packet makes a whole pan full of sweet corn goodness.  Is it a side dish or a dessert or both?  You decide.  Easy to prepare and delicious on the table. I love chi chi\'s corn cake and I love that I can purchase it from Amazon. My local grocery store stopped carrying it and I was so happy to see that I could order it from Amazon. I would give it 5 stars but not everyone in my family loves it. (I don\'t know why, it is so yummy) It is a delicious side to any mexican meal! I grew up in Southern California, so I\'ve had my share of sweet corn cakes at local restaurants. This mix is a great way to make these at home. I prepared a package of these for a friend of mine (who lives on the east coast and had never tried a corn cake)....she\'s now addicted but can\'t find them at her local store. Thank goodness for Amazon! I have tried to duplicate this without having to buy the prepackaged stuff, but have never come close. The stuff this creates is outstanding in texture and flavor. I have always like the little dollop of corn yumminess that they sell at the Tex Mex chain Chevy\'s and this is almost a spot on replication of it. Great stuff for even picky eaters like young kids. I made the recipe on the package and my family LOVED this dish. I will make it many, many times. My grandson said he wanted a whole dishful just for himself! I had never made this or had it at a mexican food diner, so I did not know what to expect.  It is good and very moist, but if you use creamed corn with added sugar in it your muffins or corn loaf will be very sweet.  I will make my own cream corn to add next time instead of using Libby\'s canned cream corn which is high in salt and sugar.  I like sweets but this was a little over the top using canned cream corn. The first ingredient in the dry mix is sugar, not Corn Masa as listed on the Amazon site so be advised this is definitely a dessert. sooo happy amazon sells this! the one grocery store that has it in my neighborhood is closing!!!! this is delicious!!! perfect for a fiesta night! Delicious.  Reminds me exactly of the corn cake they use to serve at their restaurants.  I make this with every mexican night we have at home. I\'ve got no talent in the kitchen but in today\'s economy hosts really appreciate guests who contribute to the atmosphere by bringing a side dish.  I\'d sampled this corn cake at a friends and couldn\'t believe it came from a mix.  I immediately ordered the mix from Amazon and put it to the test. So easy (water, melted butter and a cake pan) even I couldn\'t mess it up!! I took it to the next gathering where it was a hit.  I only wish it came in a smaller shipment (min. shipment is a pack of 12) but since everyone always seems to want the recipe, we can share. I too am so glad Amazon sells this!!  I sometimes add a 1/4 cup of sugar when I want it sweeter:) All the Chi Chi\'s closed in my area.  I was able to get this mix at the grocery store, but lately it has not been on the shelves. I am so happy to have found it on Amazon.  This mix is awesome.  Great for taco night!!! Our daughter was very unhappy because she could not find Chi-Chi\'s Sweet Corn Cake Mix in her grocery stores.  Thanks to Amazon.com the "fix" was easy.  We had Corn Cake while dining on Lake Powell.  Heard the grand kids were enjoying more Chi-Chi\'s Corn Cake last night.  Thank you!  SR I really like this product---when my grocery stopped carrying it, I ordered it through the mail.  This is more of a quick bread than a cake, and it requires a can of cream style corn.  The result is very moist and has a good corn flavor.  I bake it in muffin pans in cupcake papers, and a dozen are small.  It makes about 8 good sized muffins.  I also bake these longer than specified on the package, because I seem to like things that are more done than many people.  These store well in a plastic bag in the refrigerator---if they are not all eaten by the end of the meal. Chi-Chi\'s sweet corn cake is awesome.  The stores in our area stopped stocking this item.  SO HAPPY to have found it on Amazon.com.  No other corn bread/cake mix comes close to being as good as this.  It goes great with taco\'s, nacho\'s and chili.  We also like to add in some frozen corn before we bake it.  YUM!!!! so so.there was great reviews on product only made it once will try it again I\'ve been a fan of this stuff for years.  Make sure you stir it up after you pull it out of the microwave since the grease seems to float to the top.  It is quick, easy, and makes for a tasty lunch when you are short on time or don\'t feel like going out for lunch. It isn\'t healthy, despite the description above, though I did not buy it for that reason. I love pasta, but for my uses preparing a fresh batch, then adding the sauce would be both expensive, and time consuming. This is the best solution. I will buy this variety again in the future, in the can version, for more days. I\'m recently widowed so have to learn to fix for a single person. I hoped this microwaveable bowl of "Beefaroni" would provide a tasty lunch. To my surprise, I found that it was nearly all macaroni, with some tomato sauce and a very small amount of beef. The taste was OK if you like macaroni and a rather strong tomato sauce, but I expected more beef. Also, as with so many canned food these days, be prepared for a high dose of sodium -- salt, that is -- 31% of average daily requirement in one small serving. Overall, no so good. Great for a snack (I eat a 2500 calorie/day diet)... I eat this between lunch and work and it hits the spot.  An entire bowl is 400 calories.  Arrived on time and its easier and cheaper than buying in bulk at ACME or other such (not costco but i dont have my own member card) When the flowers showed up, they were in pretty bad shape.  I figured that water and the provided plant food would spruce them up within a few days.  Didn\'t happen.  They went from being dull and wilted to being dead within four days of arrival. i received the box of chocolate and was very pleased . the box was in excellent shape and was wrapped well. the candies were fresh and delicious. would get again. This 2 lb box of chocolates was a wonderful gift for my 20 year old niece!  The quality of the chocolates was amazing, but more importantly was the long lasting pleasure the young lady got.  A double gift!  Thanks Amazon!&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042GWKWO"&gt;See\'s Candies 2 lb. Assorted Chocolates&lt;/a&gt; Speaking as another Texan, I think the first rule for these delicious treats is to NOT order them during spring or summer. In fact, your safest bet is to ONLY order them in the dead of winter.  LOL!  As long as you do that, be prepared for a truly amazing treat!  This package comes with 12 bite-sized delicacies.  The chocolate is high-quality, the nuts are crunchy, and the overall taste couldn\'t be better.  Definitely worth the price! i cannot believe that i found these on amazon!!!!  i became addicted to the little, choclate covered, macadamia delights in tokyo and thought that i would be doomed to a life without them back in the states.  BE WARNED CONSUMER!  HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!!!  HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!!!  recently, i mourned the devouration of my last box... but i\'ve found them again!!!!  I CAN LIVE! I CAN LIVE!!!!!!! I really enjoyed eating this macadamia delights from Meiji. The chocolate has a great, and not too sweet, taste. The nuts are a bit small, if you are used to larger varieties, but that is a small problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found they were not good for my feeding frenzies. Stuffing a whole box down in about 3 minutes is not a good idea, as the chocolate can leave a bit of an aftertaste in the throat. Taken at a more leisurely pace, they are a real treat. I got this product ship one day express. Unfortunately, when it arrived and I opened it, all I saw was a big blob of melted chocolate with LITTLE macadamia nuts in the center of the holders. The actual product deserves 5 stars, the reason I gave it 4 stars is because its like three dollars at asianfoodgrocer.com. That\'s where I order it from, not amazon. Much lower prices. I didn\'t buy them here but I did buy them from Buford Highway Farmers Market here in Atlanta and they are wonderful. They are worth a try. :) This will be a short review (for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am somewhat of a tea connoisseur, so for me to give a tea 5 stars... well this is a first for me in an Amazon review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviews of this product, it is a beautiful delight to watch this hand sewn tea unfold in the pot; delicate, thin first flush leaves surround a beautiful red center of hibiscus.  The liquor is a light honey color, and the apricot overtones are pronounced on the palate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this tea for anyone who enjoys green (or white)teas; wants to become more familiar with them, or as a gift for someone. I only use C&amp;H Bakers Sugar for all my baking needs and I go through it FAST with a lot of baking. I looked on Amazon to see if I could purchase it in a case for ease and cost savings. At the grocery store, one 4lb carton costs less than $5, so to get three of them, it would cost $15 or less. Here on Amazon it is $28 PLUS $12 shipping. That totals $40 for a $15 product. Yep, that\'s almost 3 times more expensive than if I just purchase it at the local grocery store. I love Amazon and was really shocked to see this price. This is a definite NO THANKS, I know better than to purchase this item here! This is the sugar I use for all my white sugar needs. It\'s very fine, somewhere between the dust like qualities of powdered sugar and regular sugar. It dissolves very well into drinks without that somewhat odd tastes powdered sugar can have because of the corn starch or the granularity of not dissolving completely like granulated sugar which makes it perfect for cold drinks.&lt;br /&gt;When baking with it, because it\'s so fine, I usually use a scant cup (1 cup - 1 tablespoon) instead of a full cup. That seems to work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for meringues and fudge because it\'s so fine and dissolves so well. Too soft: I just used this sugar to bake one of the layers for a firm pound cake-like layer cake intended for decoration (Wilton Butter cake recipe). This is a pretty hardy cake and can stand up to changes in temperature etc and still turn out well. I had already baked several of the layers with regular granulated sugar before I ran out and decided to use some of this baking sugar. Be forewarned, this sugar makes cakes far too tender. The layer literally fell apart coming out of the pan and it was well cooled and in a pan liberally covered in cake release. Even when I was mixing the batter, it for some reason stuck to my stainless bowl and was impossible to scrape entirely out. I\'m sure this is good for meringues and such, but I would never attempt to use it again for a cake or even cookies. You would never get them out of or off the pan. We\'ve been trying various rices including Aquarello Carnaroli and this Vialone Nano is by far the best. It\'s very forgiving of lapses in technique and produced the creamiest risotto of the five brands of rice we\'ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to have an airtight container to store the unused rice from each package - the vacuum pack plastic is too stiff to close well. Great for risotto.  Creates creamy finished product, while maintaining a good \'al dente\' bite, better than any other rice I have used. If you want to make authentic Italian risotto for a reasonable price, buy this rice! Vialone Nano is - in my opinion - the very best for making risotto. You have to follow the true process, starting with sweated shallots, then parching the rice, then deglazing with white wine, and finally adding hot stock in small amounts while stirring often. If you follow this procedure (and/or find a good recipe), you will be rewarded with some of the creamiest, most mouth-meltingly tender rice you\'ve ever had. Why pay for it in a restaurant when it\'s so easy to make at home? Very crunchy and salty, just like described. I can also tell they use a lot of artificial  color. Not the best caviar. Might be really good for sushi! My dog is simply crazy about these treats. But what is really nice about them is that they are fairly healthy as well. Since they are hard treats they serve the purpose of both cleaning the teeth and providing a semi-long lasting morsel of enjoyment. In additon to that, since these treats are all natural, they do not contain as many of the fillers that are present in some of the other treats, making them extra healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price may seem hefty for simple dog treats but these are pretty large treats that can be broken up into smaller ones and you can\'t beat the quality. All the dogs on my Christmas list loved this. They ate it right away These seeds are awesome, good size with the perfect amount of spice.buffalo to ranch flavoring.  I\'ve only been able to find them here locally at 2 or 3 other gas stations, ordering them via Amazon is obviously cheaper and saves me nearly 4-5 dollars buying the box. This new flavor is great. Not too spicy as I thought it would be.  In fact, it has the flavor of buffalo sauce but not the heat which I like.  I tried these from the local convenience store.  But from Amazon, the shipped price is really good.  So I bought a couple of ten packs.  Can\'t wait. I\'ve been out for a few days now and need something to snack on at work. These are jumbo and flavored nicely,  I ended up saving $.40 per pack as well, good deal.  Once u go jumbo u never go back. These are good sized seeds, and they taste good, not over roasted.  I know this as I rinse them before I eat them.  The flavor is a little strong for me, which if you knew me would not surprise you.  I\'m not the biggest fan on spices that add heat.  If you like Buffalo Wings, I\'m sure you\'ll love these.  It was the "ranch" part of the flavor that caught my eye. Looking for a good tasting jumbo sunflower seed that is not too salty and has an outstanding flavor?  Then these are for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have an awesome flavor are jumbo size and the price won\'t hurt your pocketbook.  I would recommend them to anyone.  Unfortunately they are hard to find and when you do find some they fly off the shelf, so they must be good! The seeds are large and roasted perfectly. I lived in Upstate NY near Buffalo when the Buffalo wings phenomenon started and have been eating them ever since. These seeds don\'t even have the faintest resemblance to Buffalo wings. If you are looking for that taste don\'t buy them.  If you are looking for a great spicy ranch taste then these are for you.  The only flavored seeds available near me are the plain ranch. They are ok, but these have that extra bit of spice that really makes them great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying these again and highly recommend them to anyone who likes the spicy, yet not too hot ranch taste. It was this or a big tub of spice drops. These are better for diabetics. They didn\'t last long, and my wife enjoys the mess I make \'round the La-Z-Boy. The only thing keeping this product from five stars are all of the broken shells. At the top of the bag, I found a number of half shells. However, when I got to the bottom I realized that many of the seeds had collected there in a pile of shell remnants and seasoning salt. Blow the seasoning off and you may lose some seeds as well. Otherwise, a great eating experience. The jumbo size is great, and makes for easier consuming.  Those of you Ranch heads like me, do yourself a favor and immediately upgrade.  This flavor is even better, easily the best David has to offer. Great price on Amazon, especially since these flavor seeds are pretty hard to find in regular stores. These are the best sunflower seeds ever the bigger size makes them easier to eat. load of flavor in every bag! The seeds are fresh, the shells are hard and the seeds are JUMBO sized.  The taste is good, but the over-powering amount of salt ruins the experience.  The \'ranch\' flavor would be much tastier if the salt used were lessened.  Then again, without the overwhelming amount of salt, David might have to use a bit more of the flavor for which you are actually paying.  By the way, I don\'t often find items too salty, but this borders on the ridiculous, IMO.  I wholeheartedly endorse the Jumbo size seeds, as they are MUCH more enjoyable than the puny \'regular\' sized sunflower seeds by David.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future, hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the David\'s have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I finished all but a little of the case of David buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the Jumbo brand ranch flavored sunflower seeds.  I compared them back-to-back.  The Jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to David\'s.  It will be interesting how I will find the Jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile.  Right now, they seem a bit \'under-flavored\'.  Still, that is preferable to David\'s overuse of salt. The Maxwell House International Coffee - Vanilla Nut Cafe - is absolutely my favorite flavor!  Seems to be extremely difficult to locate now, though.  Last purchase was made through Amazon and hoping it will become available again soon! I couldn\'t really taste the bergamot in this tea.  It had more of a slight orange peel taste.  Since it is organic, I expected a cleaner, richer taste. It\'s OK, but not as good as the regular Twinings Earl Grey.  I have had other brands of organic that were superior to either of the Twinings, but at a much higher price. My two cats used to love this formula, but I guess they got tired of it, or maybe the formula was changed ... I only feed it occasionally now. Excellent Energy drink, I drink one-a-day before I go for my daily walk, gives me a nice boost!  I like the taste, may take a few too get used to it!  No jitters just a boost! I started using Celsius over two year ago. Gives just the right boost I needed to exercise in the mornings. No crash or after affects. Has a great taste, nothing strong or overwhelming. The description of the item is "small pieces, diced."  I would call them chopped. They\'re basically what you\'d find on a banana split or a sundae or perhaps decorating a chocolate cake or cupcake.  I like the toasted flavor and put them on oatmeal.  They do not come in a sealed package as shown in the photo.  Mine came in a folded over plastic bag inside a cardboard box. My cat LOVES Fancy Feast cat food; and this variety pack in particular makes mealtime a veritable newsworthy event! He always eats it down and he loves it; I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get eight cans of Ocean Whitefish &amp; Tuna Feast; eight more cans of Savory Salmon Feast with Cod and eight more cans still of Sole &amp; Shrimp Feast. Very good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The food does have some nutritional content; I always look for that when I buy food for the cat. There\'s some vitamin E, A, D3, B12, and B1. I like that. Naturally, ask your vet if you have any concerns about your cat\'s personal individual needs for nutritional content in their daily diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you catch a sale on this, stock up! However, I would use these cans of food within six months of buying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is one of the better brands of cat food out there; and I recommend it. Your cat will love it and it has nutritional content which is great for them, too. These Fancy Feast Variety Packs, which contain twenty-four cans, always ensure that you have a good supply of cat food on hand. I also do not have to waste my time stacking individual cans.  I always have a box of this one, the Gourmet Variety Pack, which is fish and seafood based, on hand. It contains eight cans each of ground ocean whitefish and tuna, salmon and cod, as well as sole and shrimp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also always have on hand the Fancy Feast Sliced Variety Pack, which contains eight cans each of beef, chicken hearts and livers, and turkey. In addition, I also have a box of the Fancy Feast Grilled Variety Pack on hand, at all times, which contains eight cans each of grilled beef, turkey, and chicken, each in their own savory sauce. My cat, Mamushka,  loves them all. I was drawn to this product because it\'s called a "feast", but I was somewhat put off by it being a "Fancy Feast". My cat certainly deserves a feast! I mean, he runs himself ragged from morning till night going after mice and by the end of the day he\'s bushed. And frustrated too, since I had him declawed and all. But he don\'t need anything fancy, that\'s for sure. I just want him to enjoy a cat feast and leave it at that. He\'s not one of them cat\'s that prances around with his bushy tail waving around like some lady feline. I know my Tubby Toughie would be in cat heaven if they changed the name to "Fighter Feast" or "Beastly Feast". So, I\'m giving this product 3 stars: five stars because it\'s a pretty great feast, minus three stars because the name offends Tubby Toughie, and plus one star because I like to lick the can. Great oysters, fast shipping. Can\'t find them local so I took a chance and they were GREAT! They were frozen when I got them and package was well packed. I was just a little wary ordering this because of the other reviews that said it was super salty and way too tough. But I gave it a shot anyway. I don\'t know if it was because I ordered a different flavor(Teriyaki) or if I just got lucky. Nonetheless, I think these jerky strips are some of the best I\'ve ever had. I will admit to the fact that they are just a little salty, but nothing an ice cold cola or beer of your choice won\'t fix. As per being tough, I munched down five or six right out of the container as soon as I opened it. I just couldn\'t stop myself, they were that good. For all that chewing my jaw is none the worse for the wear. So for those of you out there that are real jerky fans, this is definitely worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update** I did a little research because I was curious as to why everyone thought this jerky was too salty. I looked up the nutrition facts on all 4 flavors. Both the Original &amp; Peppered contain 650mg of sodium, the Wood Smoked had 570mg, and the Teriyaki has only 440mg of sodium. So if you thought the others were too salty, or are worried about this jerky being too salty, try the teriyaki. I highly recommend it. It\'s not too salty, just a hint of sweet from the teriyaki, but still nice pepper flavor as well. With Jack Links buying King B, it looks like they have repackaged the original beef jerky strips in this label with the same great results. I hope they keep up with the demand as everyone else finds them as I did.  Thanks for bring them back Jack Links! I dont review often, but this stuff is just what I was looking for.  I ordered about $150 of jerky to try all the types I havent yet tried, and I popped this can first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already found what i want!  The taste is excellent...i\'ma  fan of hickory smoked stuff as it is.The texture is good...not too tough, and definately not too tender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else do you need? Good taste, good texture.  Wish it was a bit cheaper at $25/lb....but what can ya do These beef jerky strips are really good.  Texture is just right.  Flavor is peppery, but also just right.  Could be more smoky for me.  This is a repeat buy on my part. Just like old style jerky.  Whole strips of meat, not compressed chips. Yum Yum. Peppery. This stuff is the real deal! Not too soft, not too hard, not too salty, no fat, and a great smokey flavor with just a touch of spice that makes your tongue tingle. For a commercially produced product, this is really a satisfying strip of jerky. I was pleasantly surprised and will definately purchase again... Walked into a convenience store and bought this for .99 and was like, nice.  Asked the counter person if I could buy it at their rate and got the brush off.  Did a little research and voila!  Amazon comes through again.  Bought two jars, and the wife and kids cleaned me out.  I will be getting this sent to me monthly soon. As processed, mass produced jerkies go, this is one of the best I\'ve had. It compares with King-B. I don\'t care for all of the poisonous preservatives and processing, but that comes with eating anything these days unless you go and find a hunter you can buy from direct.&lt;br /&gt;Fresh game jerky would be the next logical step if you can find it. we had been looking for King B brand jerky for months before contacting Jack Links to find out what happened.  They informed us that their Smokehouse brand was indeed new branding for the King B products.  With speculation on them keeping the same recipe, we orderd a jar and were not disappointed!!  The product was exactly what we had remembered the original King B to be. I will definetly be ordering this again!! This jerky reminds me a little of the artisan jerky I used to be able to find in California. The strips are thin, so they\'re easy to bite and the flavor is slightly spicy and definitely smokey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband absolutely loved it..he\'s been taking 2-3 pieces per day in his lunch and they never come back home with him the way other snacks sometimes do! I\'m buying more while they\'re on sale! let me tell you that this beef jerky has me wanting more. I have never tasted a jerky with more flavor and taste I recommend it to anyone wanting a little more out of their jerky.. A++++++++++++ Over the past two years, thanks to Amazon, I have been sampling jerky from literally all over the U.S. I finally found a tasty, jerky that doesn\'t give my jawbone a workout. Great meat flavor, an excellent snack. I miss the King B ripple style and the regular jerky too.  Thanks Jack Links for at least offering this. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AWBL82"&gt;Jack Link\'s Smokehouse Beef Jerky Strips, Wood Smoke, 30-Count Jar&lt;/a&gt; These are the real deal when it comes to jerky. The whole family loves them. When the grandkids come over they wipe me out. The 2 year old looks for the container sitting on the microwave and says Paw Paw, Stick. These come once a month via the Amazon Subscribe and Save. Just another great quality Jack Link\'s product. One of the few companies that got big, but never sacrificed quality in the process! You will love this jerky if you are a beer drinker. Recommend this product for sure for them nights around the campfires! These are great tasting and have good consistency and meatiness.  Easy to eat on the run (no mess). This jerky is the bomb!!! It is by fare the best i have ever had and I have had a lot of jerky in my day. The product is a good value for the amount you get, however it is way too salty.  The product is very dry and firm.  I think this would be good if they cut the salt content in half. I\'m really disappointed with the changes in quality -- it\'s not even the same product that we used to love.  A couple of years ago, the product was consistently fantastic, but now the taste, quality of the meat, and freshness are hit or miss...and recently it\'s all been a miss. Great flavor, and texture.  It may not be the best jerky out there, but for the price, I couldn\'t find any better.  It comes in a few different flavors, so there\'s bound to be one you like.  I just wish the shelf life was longer, I\'d love to keep this with the emergency food/water. I purchased the Wood Smoked flavor.  The reviewers who said that these are too salty were right.  They tastes like sticks of salts.  If you nibble on them very slowly, then they tastes ok as the salts disolve slowly.  If you take a big bite, then it would be like biting into a chunk of salt.  I love the texture and the stringiness of this beef jerky but I would not buy it again because of the high sodium content. This is for all the beef jerky lovers out there. If you like jerky this is the best tasting stuff that Ive found anywhere. All of the flavors are great. The black peppered in my opinion is the best and the wood smoked is a little dry but still good. I would recommend it to anybody. I used to eat these King B beef jerky sticks all the time when I was younger, they were my favorite! I figured once King B was gone so was my beloved jerky, but luckily Jack Links has brought it back. This jerky is above and beyond any of that overly-sweet bagged jerky Jack links sells. No, instead this is the way jerky should be, nice and chewy and salty yum. I know some people on here complained about the saltiness but I don\'t think they\'re overly salty, they\'re just plain delicious. Order some, you won\'t regret it. This beef jerky is extremely salty. I tried the wood smoked flavor, and I figured people were just being a bit picky. However, it really is overpowering and although it has a decent smoky flavor the salt is just way too much. The container says 570mg sodium or 24% of daily value for one serving. I would recommend trying a different product. These are the best Jerky Strips I have ever tasted. Our family has been eating them for years and they are typically a Christmas delight. The Smokehouse Jerky is some of the best out there, a perfect quick snack. It has s great smoke flavor and texture. I even started a subscription to get it once a month....save 15% by doing it.&lt;br /&gt;The only con would be a little on the salty side. If you like jerky you can\'t go wrong with this. There are literally hundreds of jerky type products out there.  This is simply my favorite.  Real strips of beef, not ground up hamberger, that tastes like meat instead of preservatives without teriyaki or any other flavoring or sauce.  Good price, good product and great taste.  You\'ll be happy with this one.  When I\'m looking for a non sugary snack, I reach for this first. A coworker brought this yummyness into the office and I am so greatful.  I am not big beef jerky fan but this stuff totally falls under my "much yum" category. This jerky is extremely addictive!  I have had most every other brand of jerky and this is by far the best jerky I have ever had.  It was originally King B Jerky. I love all different types of beef jerky, but not this one.  It has the flavor of grocery store bought beef jerky once you get over the overwhelming taste of salt. These sticks are cut thin making them tender and easy to chew, but they\'re just way too salty and definitely not worth $20 I read the reviews and thought, I like salt. I thought the saltiness was on the exterior of the jerky.  There is very little salt taste on the outside of the jerky but the saltiness comes out with every chew. The strips are about the size of a chopstick or a very thin pencil. 12 ounces for $20+ is way too expensive.  There is very little beef flavor but too be fair it is probably covered up by the salt.  These taste very similar to the chopped and formed cheap jerky at the convenience mart that you swear you will never buy again but much more salty. The amount of salt made my tongue numb, if you want good jerky keep looking. (Jack Link\'s Smokehouse Beef jerky strips, wood smoked 30-count jar) The Jack Link\'s 30 Jerky Strips were verrrryyyy SKINNY! Some were only about 1/8 inch wide and counted as one strip. If I had known this, I would NOT have ordered the beef jerky strips - tasty, but totally not worth the money!!!! too salty -- enough said. I order the wood smoked 30-count jar. Remember, the price is for only ONE JAR (not two). Was hoping that the pieces would be a bit flatter in structure, but they shy away from sausage stick territory fine enough.  Flavor wasn\'t bad, but nothing to write home about.  I\'m just glad they weren\'t that greasy. I like almost everything about this jerky, the toughness and chewiness. But it is just too salty. If you nibble it, you may enjoy it but that is not how i eat. Also, it is not good for my health to eat something this salty. I have run into too many of salty beef jerky patches recently. This review is for the wood smoked, but if other flavors contains the same amount of salt per serving, they will be just as salty. Why everything is either too fatty, sweet or salty??? Are they trying to get us addicted? I buy jerky all the time, always willing to try something new. I\'ve even made my own at home. I agree with the review that called these salt sticks, they are way too salty for my taste. Also, being a jerky eater for 40+ years, I eat it because i like the toughness and chewiness of jerk. But the tube I got was nearly un-chewable. I have bit into some hard jerky in my time, but jeez louise, these were literally like chewing leather, many of the strips would not yield to my super powered bite. this is a good name and a good value; the texture and size of the jerky is fine,&lt;br /&gt;but be prepared for the salt. It ruined it for me. Wow. The hickory smoked jerkey sticks were incredibly salty. I could not even eat half of the stick. I have had 3 different people try them and they had the same problem. They are so terrible it tastes like you are dumping salt into your mouth. Avoid these at all costs. First time ordering this jerky from amazon, and I highly recommend to everyone DO NOT BUY IT! It is harder than a rock. I have bought it from other sellers not amazon, and it is much better. The experation date is not for another year, but you cannot even bite it or chew it. Horrible, I think its the worst jerky ive ever bought! I don\'t eat beef jerky, and I wanted to buy some for a Christmas gift.  I read all of the reviews at Amazon.com and decided that Jack Links would be the best purchase.  It came nicely packaged, but there is liquid in the packaging - a lot of it.  If you turn the packaging upside down, the movement of the liquid is obvious.  So now I have to pay to return soupy beef jerky and buy a different type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three days since my original review.  Amazon cannot accept returns of food items, so it kindly replaced the beef jerky.  The replacement also has liquid in it.  It\'s not fat, but a liquid as described above.  This time, I\'m asking for a refund. I buy Jack Links Peppered Jerky every month.  I tried these as this was the first time seeing them.  Don\'t waste your money.  They are so tough even the kids wouldnt eat them!!  They do not taste anything like the other "Peppered" jerkys.  Stick with the 1 oz or the 2 oz sticks they are moist and not so much grizzle. This is the worst Jerky I have ever tasted.  It is not edible, I actually gave it to my dog and he spit it out...I kid you not.  Don\'t buy this product unless you are a bar owner and want your customers to guzzle beers to put out the salty fire that is created when you eat a small bite of this crap!!!  I deserve a refund for buying this dog food....oh excuse me I forgot even my dog won\'t eat it :-) I did not realize when I decided to purchase these that they were boxed and because of that I found them stale and hard.  I had previously purchased these at a local store who packaged them in plastic and they were soft and fresh.  Sorry that I could not give these a better review. This is the only food my cat will eat.  If I buy another variety or brand, it sits in her bowl until it gets stale &amp; I throw it out. This flavor of Fancy Feast is decidedly the favorite of our waif of a cat.  She is usually a very picky eater, but this trout flavor really gets her excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The local store ran out of this flavor and may not restock it, so I ordered online.  We got a good price and the case of food arrived in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little confused by the old label image that was on the web site that is just different enough from the new label that I had to double check that I was getting the item that I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned out to be the correct item, so all was well. I honestly cannot say that I saw any difference whatsoever in this variety compared to Friskies regular sliced beef version.  Actually, my cat preferred the regular Friskies over this one.  He\'s not really all that jazzed over these Fancy Feast varieties anyway, so if you\'re going to buy this one or the chicken, save your money and buy the regular Friskies versions.  They seem to taste better to the cat and it saves you money.  I\'ve never had a cat that ever got too thrilled over this variety over the years so I guess I\'ll get the special ones instead. I think 9 Lives does a better job on this variety than Friskies.  Or I should say my cat does.  Friskies doesn\'t look as fresh or as appetizing as 9 Lives, and my cat doesn\'t like it as well.  It just smells nasty and looks not quite as good as the 9 Lives.  I think they could definitely do better on this variety -maybe even add cheese to it!  My cat leaves this one in the dish but eats the 9 Lives version. This version is ground.  NOt my current cat\'s favorite version, but he really likes the taste. I do wish they\'d make this one not ground but in the pieces variety too.  My previous cat really liked this one and usually licked the bowl clean. But, neither wanted it more than once or twice a month.  Why, I don\'t know but it seems to be a little richer than the others. According to my cat, this stuff is just great.  He just licks himself for hours after eating this one and just loves the taste.  He will lick the bowl clean on this one and eats it usually pretty quickly.  But, he still doesn\'t want it more than 2-3 times a month because it\'s fish - not exactly his favorite food.  It\'s a great diversion from his regular fare and one that he truly appreciates. I haven\'t had a cat yet that liked this one.  It\'s just a little too interesting for them I think.  It smells nasty but I think it\'s just the taste that really gets them.  My current cat just won\'t touch it - he might eat a couple of bites if he\'s REALLY hungry, but I always wind up throwing it out.  This one is ground so if your cat likes pieces, don\'t try this one. I\'m so glad to shop at Amazon.com it have everything you need,I&lt;br /&gt;love getting my season from "Marshalls Creek Spices" it fresh, and&lt;br /&gt;taste, and good try it you will like it I\'m so glad to know about&lt;br /&gt;amazon.com I wouldn\'t know about "Marshalls Creek Spices"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank You&lt;br /&gt;  Miss Andernette Anderson&lt;br /&gt;  God Bless I love lemon pepper--I was amazed with this one--large grain and fresh.  Very large jar that delighted me because I use this in nearly everything.  Good tight jar to keep it fresh.  Very inexpensive.  Good buy for home cooks. This says 4 pack...so I assumed like other purchases that I made that it was 4 boxes each with 4 packs. Big mistake! You only get four little pouches. Who would pay over $2 for a little squirt of applesauce? Don\'t make the same mistake. Buy elsewhere. This "squeezy fruit" as my daughter calls it, is great.  Convenient, yummy, no added sugar...I love it.  I just don\'t understand why it is so expensive??  I find it at the grocery store for $2 for a four pack.  Don\'t pay this price, that\'s crazy! This is my cat\'s favorite one.  He just licks that bowl clean whenever he gets it.  I usually buy a case of this one at a time and judging from how often it sells out, other cats must love it too.  The cheese hunks are large and look quite tasty.  It\'s just a very nice variety and something I\'m sure every cat loves.  My previous cat about ran me down whenever I got it out to give to him and my current cat is no different.  Give this one a try - you\'ll be glad you did! My cat is so picky! I\'ve tried every brand and flavor and this is my cat\'s favorite. Once or twice a year for a little variety and that\'s about enough for my cat of this particular variety.  He likes it for a change from his chicken, turkey and beef, but not very often.  He will eat about 3/4 of the can and then he\'s had enough. He\'s not a huge fish fan anyway, but this stuff looks to be about the best out there in the fish varieties.  The chunks are bit sized so if your cat has a small mouth like mine does, it will be easier to chew.  Don\'t know why my cat doesn\'t like this type of fish, but he really could care less about it. At 60 years old I have had the care of cats my entire life.  Presently have four cats, three of which were "barn cats" and one came out of the woods and adopted us.  These cats love and gobble up Friskies Pate varieties "Mariner\'s Catch", "Sea Captain\'s Choice" and "Ocean Whitefish with Tuna".  I also serve as a "foster parent" for the local pet shelter and find that these 3 varieties of food are the best tolerated and completely consumed of all varieties.  The "Salmon" pate is very rich and I use it only as a special treat.  Incidentally, my cats always reach great age on Friskies.  Our cat "Kitten" died at 23 years old. She jumped off of a high bed and severely injured her spine and at the time it happened the Vet asked what food we used all of those years.  It has always been Friskies...dry and wet pet foods.  I find it is the best value and maintains our pet\'s good health right to the end.  The youngest cat that has died in our care was 18 years old and I have have had 28 cats as permanent pets, and countless foster pets over the years. Of course, nobody can ever figure out what cats will like, but our experience is the opposite of the one-star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our two Bengal cats ate kibble for years, but after some serious teeth problems, they had to switch to canned food. We tried a few different brands and flavors. They\'d eat it for a few days, then turn up their noses. Even expensive food from the vet\'s did not please them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we tried the Friskies Sea Captains Choice flavor, and they went nuts, gobbling it down like candy. We only bought a few cans at a time, figuring they would tire of it, but no, they have been eating it with gusto for a coupe of months now, so we buy it by the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\'t understand about it not smelling good; perhaps they got a bad batch, but it smells like other cat foods to us, and the pate is easy to dish out. As long as the cats love it, who are we to complain? I honestly have to say that I just won\'t buy this variety. It looks bad, smells bad and I\'m sure tastes bad because my cat won\'t touch it.  No way, no how, won\'t even look at it.  My other cat was the same way with this one.  It just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market.  I\'m sure some cats must like it because it\'s still being made, but there\'s other things out there much, much better than this one. Instead of a black graduation cap, a top hat was sent instead.  Not great for a graduation gift!  Also, I think any buyer should be aware that by "Godiva 4 Pack", they mean "4 pieces of candy"!  Very confusing description especially when you consider that the picture shows at least 5 pieces of candy! Definitely not worth the price!! These little taffy\'s are expensive. I think I paid around $11 for the pound. They taste good, but man do they give me gas. After eating about 3 my stomach would be rumbling for a few hours and I would have to pass gas a lot. My girlfriend wouldn\'t let me eat them before bed hahaha. There was never any pain involved, just gas. I know it was these doing it because we tested it over a few different days. I wouldn\'t eat the taffy some days and would be fine. All it took was a few pieces and an hour late the bubble guts would start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This information may be useful since its not on amazon. Sugar free does not = carb free. A 1 pound bag is 453g.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the manufacturer website:&lt;br /&gt;ingredients: hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, partially hydrogenated soybean and/or coconut oil, acid combinations for flavor (citric acid and/or tartaric acid), egg albumin, salt, lecithin, sucralose, natural and artificial flavors, combinations of red 40, blue 1, blue 2, yellow 5, yellow6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nutrition Facts&lt;br /&gt;Serving Size (40g)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amount Per Serving&lt;br /&gt;Calories  110  Cal from fat 20&lt;br /&gt;  % Daily Value&lt;br /&gt;Total Fat 2.5g  4%&lt;br /&gt;Saturated Fat 0g  0%&lt;br /&gt;Trans Fat 0g&lt;br /&gt;Cholesterol 0mg  0%&lt;br /&gt;Sodium  25mg  1%&lt;br /&gt;Total Carbohydrate 28g  9%&lt;br /&gt;Sugar 0g&lt;br /&gt;Protein 0g I would have given this 5 stars but took one off for the high cost. This product otherwise is just yummy! This is spoken from the perspective of a diabetic who hasn\'t had regular taffy for years but I think this would hold its own next to regular taffy pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;Its sweetened with sucralose, not maltitol so there isn\'t the worry of gastric upset which is the #1 reason I ordered it. I don\'t see why more companies don\'t forgo the maltitol and just use other sweetners that have less of an impact on digestion. The flavors are full and all different depending on color and yes even the dreaded bannana flavor tastes good.&lt;br /&gt;Its soft and chewy and I feel like I am "cheating" when I am not at all.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I found this! I bought this along with the easy freeze ice cube trays for my two dogs. My vet put my lab on a diet so I have been looking for low calories treats to feed him for his evening snack. Each packet is only 30 calories and will fill one easy freeze ice cube tray (six large ice cubes for the extra large size). One packet will also fill my labs kongxl and my terriers Kong medium. They love it and make sure they lick their Kong\'s clean without getting bored with it. Overall a great snack! Just right for making dan dan noodles and other delicious recipes.  Glad to have this in my pantry.  Flavorful vinegar will be useful for various dishes.  Product delivery was great - just as expected. milder than most vinegars, but with its own very special taste to add to Ume Plum vinegar, and cider vinegar for that hmmmmm layer of flavor! This is terrific honey.  What more can one say about it?  There was a great price when I got it, too -- much better than at the local supermarkets.'</pre>

<p>This program builds a Bigram language model from a corpus and recommends the top 3 words likely to follow a given word based on Bigram probabilities. It consists of two main functions:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>build_bigram_model:</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Processes the input text corpus to count unigrams (individual words) and bigrams (pairs of consecutive words).
Stores these counts in structured dictionaries for easy access.
2. <b>recommend_words: </b>
Uses the Bigram counts to calculate probabilities for the next word given the current word.
Ranks the possible next words by probability and returns the top recommendations.</p>

<p>Consider a Corpus C of D documents {d1,d2…..dD} and N unique tokens extracted out of the corpus C. The
N tokens will form our dictionary and the size of the Count Vector matrix M will be given by D X N. 
Each row in the matrix M contains the frequency of tokens in document D(i).</p>
<p>Let us understand this using a simple example.</p>
<p>D1: He is lazy boy. She is also lazy.</p>
<p>D2: Neeta is lazy person.</p>
<p>The dictionary created may be a list of unique tokens(words) in the corpus =
['He','is','She','lazy','boy','also','Neeta','person']
Here, D=2, N=8
The count matrix M of size 2 X 8 will be represented as –</p>
